BACKGROUND: Disease-modifying drugs are not yet available for the management of 
chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors 
(statins) have anti-inflammatory properties and are therefore being considered 
for use in the management of COPD.
OBJECTIVE: Our objective was to examine the association between statin use and 
COPD-specific outcomes in a real-world setting.
METHODS: This was a retrospective longitudinal dynamic cohort study that used 
Medicaid claims data from multiple years (2005-2008) to identify patients with 
newly diagnosed COPD. Statin therapy was determined from the prescription drug 
file using National Drug Codes (NDCs). COPD-specific outcomes such as 
hospitalizations and emergency room and outpatient visits were identified based 
on a primary diagnosis of COPD. Multivariable logistic regressions with inverse 
probability treatment weights (IPTWs) were used to examine the relationship 
between statin therapy and COPD-specific outcomes.
RESULTS: The study included 19,060 Medicaid beneficiaries with newly diagnosed 
COPD, 30.3% of whom received statins during the baseline period. Adults who 
received statins had significantly lower rates of COPD-specific hospitalizations 
(4.7 vs. 5.2%; p < 0.05), emergency room visits (13.4 vs. 15.4%; p < 0.001), and 
outpatient visits (41.4 vs. 44.7%; p < 0.001) than those who did not receive 
statin therapy. Even after adjusting for observed selection bias with IPTWs, 
adults receiving statins were less likely to have COPD-specific hospitalizations 
[adjusted odds ratio (AOR) 0.76; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.66-0.87], 
emergency room visits (AOR 0.81; 95% CI 0.75-0.89), and outpatient visits (AOR 
0.86; 95% CI 0.80-0.91) than those not receiving statins.
CONCLUSIONS: Findings from this study suggest statins have beneficial effects in 
patients with newly diagnosed COPD and warrant further clinical trial 
investigation.

BACKGROUND: Pulmonary hypertension (PH) is a multi-causal disease and no 
satisfactory therapeutic strategies for it. Statins have been suggested as 
potential drugs in PH, whose effects in different clinic types of PH have not 
been conclusive. In this study, we included randomized controlled clinical 
trials (RCTs) evaluating the efficacy and safety of statins therapy in PH.
METHODS: We searched databases including Medline, Embase, Cochrane, PubMed and 
Web of science, with time up to January 1, 2019. With 95% confidence interval 
(CI), weighted mean difference (WMD) or standardized mean difference (SMD) was 
pooled and calculated in a random or fixed effect model according to I2 
statistic.
RESULTS: A total of nine RCTs with 657 patients were included. Four types of 
statins (atorvastatin, pravastatin, rosuvastatin and simvastatin) were used at 
different doses (10-80 mg daily) for up to 6 months. In the pooled-data 
analysis, compared with placebo, there were significant improvements in 
pulmonary arterial pressure (PAP), in addition to low-density lipoprotein (LDL) 
in patients treated with statins, but not in 6-minute walking distance (6MWD), 
cardiac index (CDI). No more adverse events and all-cause mortality were 
revealed. Subgroup analysis indicated that statins could decrease PAP in the 
subtype of PH due to chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), but not 
pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH).
CONCLUSIONS: This study indicates that statins can efficiently and safely reduce 
PAP in PH, especially in the subtype due to COPD. Further RCTs are needed to 
focus on the efficacy and safety of statin therapy in different subtypes of PH.

Cytokines are biological response modifiers involved in the pathophysiology of 
chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). This study investigated the 
potential use of cytokines as disease severity biomarkers in COPD patients and 
the possible effect of statin therapy on cytokine expression. Possible 
associations between cytokines, body mass index (BMI) and smoking have also been 
studied. Cytokines IFN-γ, IL-2, IL-12 p70, TNF-α, TNF-β, IL-4, IL-5, IL-6, 
IL-10, IL-1β and IL-8 were measured in the plasma of 100 clinically stable COPD 
patients using a fluorescent bead immunoassay on a flow cytometer. When patients 
were grouped according to Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease 
(GOLD) stage (A-D), no significant differences in cytokine concentrations were 
found (p > .05). Significantly decreased concentrations of IL-1β, IL-2, IL-4, 
IL-8, IL-10, IL-12p70 and TNF-α were found in COPD patients receiving statin 
therapy in comparison with COPD patients not receiving statin therapy (p < .05). 
COPD patients with increased BMI (>25) had decreased IL-2 (p=.038), IL-8 
(p = .039) and IL-10 (p = .005) concentrations compared to normal BMI (20-25) 
patients. Current COPD smokers had increased concentrations of IL-5 (p = .037) 
compared to former COPD smokers. Hierarchical cluster analysis showed several 
patterns of measured cytokines in serum of patients with stable COPD. Statin 
therapy is associated with decreased expression of selected Th1 and Th2 
cytokines in COPD, and this effect could be of relevance in COPD patients with 
increased cardiovascular risk. Concentrations of Th1 and Th2 cytokines in plasma 
cannot be used as biomarkers of disease severity or progression of COPD.

Objective: The effects of statins on the risk of hepatic, renal, respiratory, 
and heart failure among patients with asthma-chronic obstructive pulmonary 
disease overlap (ACO) have not been reported. Design: Time-dependent 
population-based study. Setting: Patient data from 2000 to 2010 were retrieved 
from the Taiwan National Health Insurance Research Database. Patients: We 
divided patients with ACO into cohorts of statin use (N = 1,211) and nonuse (N = 
7,443). Measurements and Main Results: The cumulative incidence rates of 
hepatic, renal, respiratory, and heart failure were analyzed through Cox 
proportional regression analysis with time-dependent variables. After adjustment 
for multiple confounding factors, including age, sex, comorbidities, and 
medications [statins, inhaled corticosteroid (ICS), or oral steroid (OS)], the 
adjusted hazard ratios (aHRs) [95% confidence intervals (CIs)] for hepatic, 
renal, respiratory, and heart failure were 0.50 (0.40-0.64), 0.49 (0.38-0.64), 
0.61 (0.27-2.21), and 0.47 (0.37-0.60), respectively. The aHRs (95% CIs) for 
statin use with [ICS, OS] for hepatic, renal, and heart failure were [0.36 
(0.20-0.66), 0.52 (0.39-0.70)]; [0.82 (0.51-1.34), 0.46 (0.33-0.63)]; and [0.66 
(0.40-1.07), 0.48 (0.37-0.64)], respectively. Conclusions: The ACO cohort with 
statin use exhibited lower risk of hepatic, renal, and heart failure than any 
other cohort, regardless of age, sex, comorbidities, or ICS or OS use. Regarding 
the combined use of statins and ICS, the risks of hepatic failure were lower. 
For the combined use of statins and OS, hepatic, renal, and heart failure were 
less frequent.

BACKGROUND: We tested the hypothesis that statin use in individuals with COPD is 
associated with a reduced risk of exacerbations.
METHODS: We identified 5794 individuals with COPD and a measurement of C 
reactive protein (CRP) in the Copenhagen General Population Study (2003-2008). 
During 3 years of follow-up we recorded exacerbations with hospital admissions 
or oral corticosteroid treatment. In a nested case-control design, matching on 
age, gender, smoking, COPD severity and comorbidity, we estimated the 
association between statin use and exacerbations. In addition, we examined the 
association between statin use and high CRP (>3 mg/L), and the association 
between high CRP and exacerbations during follow-up.
RESULTS: Statin use was associated with reduced odds of exacerbations in crude 
analysis, OR=0.68 (95% CI 0.51 to 0.91, p=0.01), as well as in multivariable 
conditional logistic regression analysis, OR=0.67 (0.48 to 0.92, p=0.01). 
However, in the subgroup with the most severe COPD and without cardiovascular 
comorbidity, we observed a null association between statin use and 
exacerbations, OR=1.1 (0.5 to 2.1, p=0.83). Furthermore, statin use was 
associated with reduced odds of a high CRP, OR=0.69 (0.56 to 0.85, p<0.001), and 
a high CRP was associated with an increased risk of exacerbations, HR=1.62 (1.35 
to 1.94, p<0.001). We estimated the percentage of excess risk of the association 
of statin use with exacerbations possibly mediated through a reduction of CRP to 
be 14% (4-51%).
CONCLUSIONS: Statin use was associated with reduced odds of exacerbations in 
individuals with COPD from the general population, although this was not 
apparent in those with the most severe COPD without cardiovascular comorbidity. 
Statins may thus only associate with reduced risk of exacerbations in patients 
with COPD with coexisting cardiovascular disease.

BACKGROUND: Much controversy persists regarding the place of statin drugs in the 
treatment of patients with COPD. This systematic review and meta-analysis sought 
to determine the clinical efficacy of statin therapy in COPD.
METHODS: We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, the Cochrane Database, and PubMed for 
relevant clinical studies. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing the 
effects of statin drugs with placebo in COPD populations were included. Pooled 
estimates were calculated using a random-effects model. Heterogeneity was 
determined using the I2 statistic.
RESULTS: Ten trials with a total of 1,471 patients were included. Statin 
treatment was associated with a larger improvement in exercise capacity, lung 
function, and St. George's Respiratory Questionnaire score compared with 
placebo, but there were no statistically significant differences in inflammatory 
markers, all-cause mortality, and safety outcomes; however, subgroup analysis 
indicated that statin drugs improved clinical outcomes in the subjects from 
trials enrolling patients with overt cardiovascular disease (CVD), elevated 
baseline C-reactive protein levels, or a high cholesterol level.
CONCLUSIONS: The findings from this systematic review suggest a role for statin 
drugs in patients with COPD and coexisting CVD, evidence of increased systemic 
inflammation, or hyperlipidemia with respect to improving exercise tolerance and 
pulmonary function. These findings need to be confirmed by RCTs specifically 
designed to test this hypothesis and identify appropriate patients for statin 
use.

Clinical Studies of Statins in Asthma and COPD.

Immunomodulatory effects of statins in vitro and in experimental models of 
asthma and COPD could potentially be relevant to the treatment of chronic airway 
diseases. This article provides an overview of the evidence from the key 
clinical studies on the effects of statins on clinical outcomes and inflammatory 
biomarkers in asthma and COPD. Future directions for clinical studies of statins 
in asthma and COPD are discussed. A small number of randomized controlled trials 
(RCTs) in adults with mild to moderate asthma suggest that short-term statin 
treatment does not improve lung function or symptom control, except for a 
possible improvement in quality of life and symptoms in smokers with asthma. 
Several observation studies report that statin use in asthma is associated with 
a reduced risk of asthma-related emergency department visits, oral 
corticosteroid dispensing or hospital admissions. Statins treatment in asthma 
may have modest local anti-inflammatory effects in the airways. There is a need 
for a large RCT examining the effects of statins on reducing exacerbations, 
particularly in severe asthma. In COPD, observational studies suggest that 
statin use is associated with reduced morbidity and/or mortality, whereas a 
large RCT concluded that simvastatin did not reduce exacerbations in patients 
with COPD that had no cardiovascular indication for statin treatment. It is 
possible that a subgroup of COPD patients with cardiovascular indications for 
statins and/or systemic inflammation may obtain clinical benefit from statin 
treatment. Understanding the immunomodulatory effects of statins in asthma and 
COPD may lead to the development of novel targeted interventions.

BACKGROUND: Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is associated with a 
two-to-five fold increase in the risk of coronary artery disease independent of 
shared risk factors. This association is hypothesized to be mediated by systemic 
inflammation but this link has not been established.
METHODS: We included 300 participants enrolled in the SPIROMICS cohort, 75 each 
of lifetime non-smokers, smokers without airflow obstruction, mild-moderate 
COPD, and severe-very severe COPD. We quantified emphysema and airway disease on 
computed tomography, characterized visual emphysema subtypes (centrilobular and 
paraseptal) and airway disease, and used the Weston visual score to quantify 
coronary artery calcification (CAC). We used the Sobel test to determine whether 
markers of systemic inflammation mediated a link between spirometric and 
radiographic features of COPD and CAC.
RESULTS: FEV1/FVC but not quantitative emphysema or airway wall thickening was 
associated with CAC (p = 0.036), after adjustment for demographics, diabetes 
mellitus, hypertension, statin use, and CT scanner type. To explain this 
discordance, we examined visual subtypes of emphysema and airway disease, and 
found that centrilobular emphysema but not paraseptal emphysema or bronchial 
thickening was independently associated with CAC (p = 0.019). MMP3, VCAM1, CXCL5 
and CXCL9 mediated 8, 8, 7 and 16% of the association between FEV1/FVC and CAC, 
respectively. Similar biomarkers partially mediated the association between 
centrilobular emphysema and CAC.
CONCLUSIONS: The association between airflow obstruction and coronary 
calcification is driven primarily by the centrilobular subtype of emphysema, and 
is linked through bioactive molecules implicated in the pathogenesis of 
atherosclerosis.

BACKGROUND: The use of statin and antiplatelet medications has been advocated in 
patients with cerebrovascular disease as primary medical therapy and as an 
adjunct to carotid endarterectomy (CEA). Our goal was to assess the prevalence 
of preoperative statin and antiplatelet use and its effect on perioperative 
outcomes after CEA.
METHODS: The American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement 
Program targeted CEA database was queried for patients undergoing CEA between 
2011 and 2014. Multivariable analysis was used to assess the effect of 
preoperative statin and antiplatelet use on CEA.
RESULTS: There were 13,521 CEAs identified. The average age was 71 years, and 
61.5% were male. More than half of patients (57.9%) were asymptomatic. 
Preoperative statin use was seen in 80.5% of patients, and antiplatelet use was 
seen in 89.3% of patients. Statin use was more common in patients with higher 
body mass index, independent functional status, diabetes, hypertension, bleeding 
disorders or anticoagulation, nonsmokers, and asymptomatic patients (P < 0.05). 
On univariate analysis, statin use was not associated with postoperative 
myocardial infarction (MI) (1.9% vs. 1.4%, P = 0.085), stroke (1.8% vs. 1.9%, 
P = 0.55), transient ischemic attack (TIA) (0.9% vs. 1.1%), or major adverse 
cardiovascular events (MACE) (4% vs. 3.6%). On multivariate analysis, 
preoperative statin use did not independently affect 30-day mortality (odds 
ratio [OR]: 0.94, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.55-1.6, P = 0.825), 
perioperative MI (OR 1.1, 95% CI 0.77-1.58, P = 0.573), stroke (OR: 0.891, 95% 
CI: 0.64-1.2, P = 0.42), or MACE (OR 1.03, 95% CI: 0.81-1.32, P = 0.806). 
Antiplatelet use was more common with male gender, nonsmoking, diabetes, 
hypertension, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, dyspnea, and asymptomatic 
carotid disease. On univariate analysis, antiplatelet use showed no effect on 
30-day mortality (0.7% vs. 1%, P = 0.28), MI (1.9% vs. 1.7%, P = 0.73), stroke 
(1.8% vs. 1.8%, P = 0.94), TIA (0.9% vs. 1%, P = 0.63), or MACE (3.9% vs. 4%, 
P = 0.8). On multivariate analysis, preoperative antiplatelet use did not 
independently affect 30-day mortality (OR: 0.67, 95% CI: 0.37-1.3, P = 0.19), 
perioperative MI (OR: 0.9, 95% CI: 0.59-1.38, P = 0.637), stroke (OR: 0.92, 95% 
CI: 0.61-1.4, P = 0.69), or MACE (OR: 0.88, 95% CI: 0.66-1.18, P = 0.39).
CONCLUSIONS: Preoperative statin and antiplatelet use in patients undergoing CEA 
was more often observed in patients with higher rates of comorbidities and 
asymptomatic disease, and this may represent closer follow-up and engagement 
with primary care physicians in this patient cohort. Preoperative statin and 
antiplatelet use did not affect perioperative outcomes suggesting that its 
short-term use is not essential. In patients who are not on statins or 
antiplatelet medications, CEA can safely be performed before consideration is 
given to their initiation.

INTRODUCTION: Laboratory and epidemiological evidence have suggested that statin 
use may protect against the development of certain cancers, including 
endometrial cancer. In a nationwide registry-based case-control study, we 
examined the association between statin use and risk of endometrial cancer.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: Cases were female residents of Denmark with a primary 
diagnosis of endometrial cancer during 2000-2009. For each case, we selected 15 
female population controls matched on date of birth (±one month) using risk-set 
sampling. Ever use of statin was defined as two or more prescriptions on 
separate dates. Conditional logistic regressions were used to estimate 
age-matched (by design) and multivariable-adjusted odds ratios (ORs) and 95% 
confidence intervals (CI) for endometrial cancer associated with statin use. The 
multivariable-adjusted models included parity, hormone replacement therapy 
(HRT), obesity, diabetes, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and education. 
We evaluated whether the association between statin use and endometrial cancer 
varied with duration and intensity of statin use, type of endometrial cancer or 
patient characteristics.
RESULTS: The study population comprised 5382 endometrial cancer cases and 72 127 
population controls. We observed no association between ever use of statins and 
endometrial cancer risk (OR 1.03, 95% CI 0.94-1.14). In addition, endometrial 
cancer risk did not vary substantially with duration or intensity of statin use. 
Stratification by type of endometrial cancer also yielded neutral ORs.
CONCLUSIONS: In our nationwide case-control study, we found no association 
between statin use and risk of endometrial cancer.

Challenges in the management of asthma associated with smoking-induced airway 
diseases.

INTRODUCTION: Smoking-induced airway diseases such as chronic bronchitis, 
emphysema, and small airway dysfunction contribute to the chronic respiratory 
symptoms experienced by adults with asthma, including those with spirometric 
chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), termed asthma-COPD overlap (ACO). 
Drug treatment of symptomatic smokers with asthma or ACO is uncertain due to 
their exclusion from most clinical trials.
AREAS COVERED: This review summarizes evidence for the efficacy of small 
molecule drugs used in the clinic to treat current and former smokers with a 
diagnostic label of asthma or ACO. Other therapeutic interventions are reviewed, 
including smoking cessation and biologics.
EXPERT OPINION: Clinical trials and observational studies suggest that smoking 
cessation and approved drugs used to treat non-smokers with asthma produce 
clinical benefits in smokers with asthma or ACO, although the overall quality of 
evidence is low. The efficacy of some treatments for asthma is altered in 
current smokers, including reduced responsiveness to short-term inhaled 
corticosteroids and possibly improved responsiveness to leukotriene receptor 
antagonists. Preliminary findings suggest that low-dose theophylline, statins, 
and biologics, such as omalizumab, mepolizumab, and dupilumab, may improve 
clinical outcomes in smokers with asthma or ACO. Improved phenotyping and 
endotyping of asthma and smoking-induced airway diseases should lead to better 
targeted therapies.

High-sensitivity C-reactive protein in heart failure with preserved ejection 
fraction.

States of America.

BACKGROUND: Microvascular inflammation may contribute to the pathogenesis of 
both heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) and pulmonary 
hypertension (PH). We investigated whether the inflammation biomarker C-reactive 
protein (CRP) was associated with clinical characteristics, disease severity or 
PH in HFpEF.
METHODS: Patients in the Phosphodiesterase-5 Inhibition to Improve Clinical 
Status and Exercise Capacity in Diastolic Heart failure (RELAX) trial had 
baseline high-sensitivity CRP levels measured (n = 214). Clinical 
characteristics, exercise performance, echocardiographic variables and 
biomarkers of neurohumoral activation, fibrosis and myocardial necrosis were 
assessed. Patients with normal (≤3mg/L) versus high (>3mg/L) CRP levels were 
compared.
RESULTS: The median CRP level was 3.69mg/L. CRP was elevated in 57% of patients. 
High CRP levels were associated with younger age, higher body mass index (BMI), 
chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), lower peak oxygen consumption and 
higher endothelin-1 and aldosterone levels. CRP increased progressively with the 
number of comorbidities (0.7mg/L per increment in comorbidity number, P = 0.02). 
Adjusting for age, BMI and statin use, high CRP levels were additionally 
associated with atrial fibrillation, right ventricular dysfunction, and higher 
N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide levels (P<0.05 for all). CRP was not 
associated with PH or left ventricular function. CRP did not identify responders 
to sildenafil(P-value for interaction 0.13).
CONCLUSIONS: In HFpEF, high CRP is associated with greater comorbidity burden 
and some markers of disease severity but CRP was normal in 40% of patients. 
These findings support the presence of comorbidity-driven systemic inflammation 
in HFpEF but also the need to study other biomarkers which may better reflect 
the presence of systemic inflammation.

BACKGROUND: Both chronic inflammation and cardiovascular comorbidity play an 
important role in the morbidity and mortality of patients with chronic 
obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Statins could be a potential adjunct 
therapy. The additional effects of statins in COPD are, however, still under 
discussion. The aim of this study is to further investigate the association of 
statin use with clinical outcomes in a well-described COPD cohort.
METHODS: 795 patients of the Cohort of Mortality and Inflammation in COPD 
(COMIC) study were divided into statin users or not. Statin use was defined as 
having a statin for at least 90 consecutive days after inclusion. Outcome 
parameters were 3-year survival, based on all-cause mortality, time until first 
hospitalisation for an acute exacerbation of COPD (AECOPD) and time until first 
community-acquired pneumonia (CAP). A sensitivity analysis was performed without 
patients who started a statin 3 months or more after inclusion to exclude 
immortal time bias.
RESULTS: Statin use resulted in a better overall survival (corrected HR 0.70 
(95% CI 0.51 to 0.96) in multivariate analysis), but in the sensitivity analysis 
this association disappeared. Statin use was not associated with time until 
first hospitalisation for an AECOPD (cHR 0.95, 95% CI 0.74 to 1.22) or time 
until first CAP (cHR 1.1, 95% CI 0.83 to 1.47).
CONCLUSIONS: In the COMIC study, statin use is not associated with a reduced 
risk of all-cause mortality, time until first hospitalisation for an AECOPD or 
time until first CAP in patients with COPD.

BACKGROUND: Statins are effective for primary and secondary prevention of 
atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. They also have systemic 
anti-inflammatory and immunomodulating properties suggesting potential utility 
for improving clinical outcomes for a wide range of diseases. The literature 
provides data suggesting benefit in patients with comorbidities associated with 
contrast-induced nephropathy (CIN), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease 
(COPD), pneumonia, head injury, neurological disease (e.g. Alzheimer's and 
Parkinson's disease), prostate cancer, nuclear cataract and spinal cord injury. 
This systematic review evaluates the current evidence supporting the potential 
benefit of statins outside their customary role of attenuating cardiovascular 
risk reduction.
METHODS: The electronic databases MEDLINE, EMBASE, and clinicaltrials.gov were 
searched for studies published January 2000 - March 2018 reporting comorbidity 
reduction associated with statin use.
RESULTS: Fifty-eight publications that satisfied our selection criteria (based 
on the PRISM guidance for systematic reviews) were selected and included 
case-control, cohort, cross-sectional and observational studies as well as 
systematic reviews and meta-analyses. Ten studies addressed statin use and 
incidence of CIN after coronary imaging; 8 addressed statin use in patients with 
COPD; 14 addressed statin use and comorbidity reduction associated with head 
injury and/or a neurological disease disorder; 5 addressed the association 
between statin use and nuclear cataract; 9 addressed the association between 
statin use and prostate/colorectal cancer; 9 studies addressed the role of 
statin use in treating infections; and 3 addressed the association between 
statin use and spinal cord injury related survival rate.
CONCLUSION: Overall, the literature supports beneficial pleiotropic effects of 
statin use in contrastinduced nephropathy, head injury, Alzheimer's and 
Parkinson's disease, nuclear cataract, prostate cancer, infection management, 
and spinal cord injury. Further investigation is warranted, and randomized 
clinical trials are needed to confirm the clinical utility suggested by the 
reported studies included in this meta-analysis.

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a debilitating, irreversible 
disease with currently available therapies targeting symptom control and 
exacerbation reduction. A need for alternative disease-modifying therapies 
remains, specifically those that may have antiinflammatory and immunomodulatory 
properties that impact the pathophysiologic components of COPD. Statin drugs, 
the current gold standard for the treatment of dyslipidemia and prevention of 
cardiovascular disease (CVD), contain properties that affect the inflammatory 
disease processes seen in COPD. Several retrospective studies have demonstrated 
that statins may have a benefit in the reduction of morbidity and mortality in 
patients with COPD. This has led to prospective trials evaluating the impact of 
statins on various COPD-related outcomes. This article reviews the current body 
of prospective evidence for use of statins in patients with COPD. A search of 
the PubMed/Medline database of English-language articles was conducted from 1964 
through November 2015; references of relevant articles were also reviewed for 
qualifying studies. Prospective studies of all types relating to statin use in 
patients with COPD were included if they had COPD- or respiratory-related 
outcomes; ultimately, eight studies were identified for this review. Statin 
effects on exacerbation rates, mortality, and inflammatory markers in patients 
with COPD are discussed. Strong prospective evidence does not currently exist to 
suggest that statins provide a clinical benefit in patients with COPD who do not 
have other CVD risk factors. Benefits from statins that have been illustrated 
are likely explained by their impact on underlying CVD risk factors rather than 
the COPD disease process. An opportunity exists for unanswered questions to be 
addressed in future studies.

OBJECTIVE: The benefit of statins in reducing perioperative cardiovascular 
events in patients undergoing suprainguinal bypass is still controversial. The 
purpose of this study was to evaluate the association between statin use and 
perioperative mortality in patients undergoing aortobifemoral bypass (ABFB) for 
aortoiliac occlusive disease.
METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed all patients who had ABFB in the American 
College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program data set from 
2011 to 2016. Univariable (t-test, χ2 test, or Fisher exact test) and 
multivariable logistic regression analyses were used to compare patients' 
characteristics and the primary outcome (30-day mortality) between statin users 
and nonstatin users. Propensity score matching between statin users and nonusers 
was also performed on the basis of variables that were different between the two 
groups.
RESULTS: A total of 4445 patients underwent ABFB. Of those, 3032 (68.2%) were 
taking statins. Compared with nonstatin users, statins users were older (median 
[interquartile range], 67 years [59-74 years] vs 63 years [56-72 years]; P < 
.01) and more likely to be diabetic (31% vs 16%) and hypertensive (84% vs 63%) 
and to have a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (20% vs 17%; all 
P < .05). Statin users had lower rates of 30-day mortality (3.4% vs 4.7%; P = 
.03) and renal complications (2.5% vs 3.7%; P = .04) compared with nonstatin 
users. After adjustment for patients' demographics (age, sex, race), 
comorbidities (diabetes, hypertension, congestive heart failure, chronic 
obstructive pulmonary disease, chronic kidney disease, dialysis, bleeding 
disorder), smoking, clinical presentation (claudication vs critical limb 
ischemia), and elective surgery status, statin use was associated with 32% 
reduction in 30-day mortality (odds ratio, 0.68; 95% confidence interval, 
0.47-0.96; P = .03). Propensity score matching showed similar results (odds 
ratio, 0.63; 95% confidence interval, 0.41-0.95; P = .03).
CONCLUSIONS: This is the largest study to date demonstrating an association 
between preoperative statin use and lower 30-day mortality after ABFB for 
aortoiliac occlusive disease. This study highlights an area of potential quality 
improvement as one-third of the patients undergoing this procedure are not 
receiving statins.

Mevalonate signaling, COPD and cancer: the statins and beyond.

Hopkins RJ(1), Young RP(1).

Zealand.

Evidence suggests that smoking confers a persistent and/or exaggerated 
inflammatory response in the lungs that, with underlying genetic susceptibility, 
may result in lung remodeling and impaired repair. The innate immune response to 
smoking described above, which is modified by the mevalonate pathway, provides a 
plausible pathogenic link between the development of chronic obstructive 
pulmonary disease and lung cancer. The mevalonate pathway modifies innate 
responsiveness through important intracellular signaling molecules called 
guanine phosphate transferases (GTPases) such as Rho-A. Smoke exposure activates 
cell surface proteins which, through the mediating influence of GTPases, then 
modifies the activation of nuclear factor kappa -light-chain-enhancer of 
activated B cells (NFĸB) its downstream effects on genes underlying innate 
immunity, neutrophilic inflammation and carcinogenesis. The mevalonate pathway 
is modifiable through the enzyme 3-hydroxy-3-methyl-glutaryl-Coenzyme A 
(HMGCo-A) reductase. This enzyme controls the rate limiting step of the 
mevalonate pathway and is subject to inhibition by statin drugs (HMGCo-A 
reductase inhibitors) and small chain fatty acids derived from high dietary 
fiber intake. Ths, inhibitory effect dampens the innate immune response to 
smoking and may modify pulmonary inflammation and lung remodeling. This article 
is a symposia summary outlining the preclinical and clinical data suggesting 
that statins and a high-fiber diet may have a chemopreventive effect on lung 
cancer.

BACKGROUND: Many effects of statins on non-cardiovascular disease (non-CVD) 
outcomes have been reported.
PURPOSE: To evaluate the quantity, validity, and credibility of evidence 
regarding associations between statins and non-CVD outcomes and the effects of 
statins on these outcomes.
DATA SOURCES: MEDLINE and EMBASE (English terms only, inception to 28 May 2018).
STUDY SELECTION: Meta-analyses (published in English) of observational studies 
and of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that examined non-CVD outcomes of 
statin intake.
DATA EXTRACTION: Two investigators extracted data from meta-analyses and 
individual studies. Credibility assessments based on summary effect sizes from a 
random-effects model, between-study heterogeneity, 95% prediction interval, 
small-study effect, excess significance, and credibility ceilings were devised 
to classify evidence.
DATA SYNTHESIS: This review explored 278 unique non-CVD outcomes from 112 
meta-analyses of observational studies and 144 meta-analyses of RCTs. For 
observational studies, no convincing (class I) evidence, 2 highly suggestive 
(class II) associations (decreased cancer mortality in patients with cancer and 
decreased exacerbation in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease), 
21 suggestive (class III) associations, and 42 weak (class IV) associations were 
identified. One outcome from the RCTs (decreased all-cause mortality in patients 
with chronic kidney disease) attained a sufficient amount of evidence with no 
hints of bias. For adverse events, observational studies showed suggestive 
evidence that statins increase the risk for diabetes and myopathy. Among the 
RCTs, no statistically significant effects were found on myopathy, myalgia, or 
rhabdomyolysis.
LIMITATIONS: Studies with relevant data and outcomes not included in the 
meta-analyses may have been missed. Credibility assessments relied on several 
assumptions and arbitrary thresholds.
CONCLUSION: The absence of convincing evidence of an association between statins 
and non-CVD outcomes supports leaving the current recommendations unchanged.

RATIONALE: The potential benefits of statins for the prevention of exacerbations 
in patients with COPD remains controversial. No previous studies have 
investigated the impact of statins on clinical outcomes in COPD patients with 
frequent exacerbations.
OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to evaluate the association between the use of 
statins and the risk of subsequent hospitalized exacerbations in COPD frequent 
exacerbators.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We conducted a population-based cohort study using the 
Taiwan National Health Insurance Research Database. 139,223 COPD patients with a 
first hospitalized exacerbation between 2004 and 2012 were analyzed. Among them, 
35,482 had a second hospitalized exacerbation within a year after the first 
exacerbation, and were defined as frequent exacerbators. 1:4 propensity score 
matching was used to create matched samples of statin users and non-users. The 
competing risk regression analysis model was used to evaluate the association 
between statin use and exacerbation risk.
RESULTS: The use of statins was associated with a significantly reduced risk in 
subsequent hospitalized exacerbations in COPD patients after their first 
hospitalized exacerbation (adjusted subdistribution hazard ration [SHR], 0.89; 
95% CI, 0.85-0.93, P<0.001). In frequent exacerbators, the SHR for subsequent 
hospitalized exacerbations in statins users was 0.88 (95% CI, 0.81-0.94, 
P=0.001). Subgroup analysis among frequent exacerbators demonstrated that the 
use of statins only provided a protective effect against subsequent hospitalized 
exacerbations in male patients aged 75 years and older, with coexisting diabetes 
mellitus, hypertension or cardiovascular disease, and no protective effect was 
observed in those with lung cancer or depression. Current use of statins was 
associated with a greater protective effect for reducing subsequent hospitalized 
exacerbation.
CONCLUSION: The use of statins was associated with a significant reduction in 
the risk of hospitalized exacerbations in COPD patients after a first 
hospitalized exacerbation and in specified COPD frequent exacerbators.

OBJECTIVE: Above-knee amputations (AKAs) and below-knee amputations (BKAs) are 
associated with high postoperative mortality rates. In this study, we examined 
factors associated with 30-day, 90-day, and 1-year mortality in patients who 
underwent a major lower extremity amputation.
METHODS: We queried a prospectively collected institutional database for all 
patients who underwent AKA or BKA with primary or secondary closure, during a 
5-year period, between November 2009 and November 2014. Predictors of 30- and 
90-day mortality were determined by multivariable logistic regression, and risk 
indexes for 1-year mortality were determined with Cox proportional hazards 
model.
RESULTS: We identified 811 patients who underwent AKA (n = 325) or BKA (n = 
486). The 30-day mortality was 8.4% (AKA, 13.5%; BKA, 4.9%; P < .001) and 90-day 
mortality was 15.4% (AKA, 24.3%; BKA, 9.45%; P < .001). Predictors of 30-day 
mortality included AKA (odds ratio [OR], 3.09; 95% confidence interval [CI], 
1.76-5.53), emergency operation (OR, 2.86; 95% CI, 1.56-5.14), chronic 
obstructive pulmonary disease (OR, 3.09; 95% CI, 1.07-7.81), end-stage renal 
disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis (HD; OR, 2.35; 95% CI, 1.24-4.33), and chronic 
kidney disease stages 3 (OR, 1.84; 95% CI, 1.00-3.37) and 4 (OR, 2.33; 95% CI, 
1.01-4.98). Predictors of 90-day mortality included age (OR, 1.02; 95% CI, 
1.00-1.04), ESRD on HD (OR, 2.56; 95% CI, 1.55-4.22), AKA (OR, 2.61; 95% CI, 
1.70-4.05), history of coronary artery bypass grafting (OR, 2.04; 95% CI, 
1.06-3.87), and medium-intensity or high-intensity statin (OR, 0.46; 95% CI, 
0.29-0.73). One-year survival for the overall cohort was 73.7% (95% CI, 
70.8%-76.8%). Predictors of 1-year mortality included AKA (hazard ratio [HR], 
2.07; 95% CI, 1.54-2.77), coronary artery bypass grafting (HR, 1.57; 95% CI, 
1.07-2.32), age >70 years (HR, 1.39; 95% CI, 1.02-1.88), gangrene (HR, 1.44; 95% 
CI, 1.07-1.94), ESRD on HD (HR, 1.96; 95% CI, 1.42-2.70), chronic obstructive 
pulmonary disease (HR, 2.54; 95% CI, 1.52-4.25), Caucasian race (HR, 1.62; 95% 
CI, 1.18-2.22), history of open lower extremity revascularization (HR, 0.71; 95% 
CI, 0.51-1.00) and undergoing bilateral amputations (HR, 2.10; 95% CI, 
1.06-4.15). In the year after amputation, medium-intensity statin (HR, 0.64; 95% 
CI, 0.47-0.87) and high-intensity statin (HR, 0.56; 95% CI, 0.33-0.95) conferred 
a mortality benefit. Low-intensity statins did not confer protection from 
mortality. At 1 year after amputation, only 44.7% of patients were receiving 
appropriate statin therapy.
CONCLUSIONS: AKA and BKA have historically been associated with high mortality 
rates. Medium-intensity and high-intensity statin therapies were associated with 
a mortality benefit at 1 year. We have identified initiation of statin therapy 
in this high-risk population as a gap in patient care.

BACKGROUND: Patients with COPD are often prescribed statin drugs due to the 
increased prevalence of cardiovascular disease. There is considerable debate 
about the benefits conferred by statin drugs in patients with COPD. This study 
evaluates the association of statin drug use with all-cause and lung-related 
mortality in patients with COPD.
METHODS: This study uses population-based administrative data for the province 
of British Columbia, Canada. A cohort of patients with COPD was identified based 
on individual patient prescription records. Statin drug exposure was ascertained 
in the 1-year period after the COPD diagnosis. The primary and secondary 
outcomes, all-cause and lung-related mortality, respectively, were evaluated in 
the 1-year period thereafter using multivariate Cox proportional hazards models 
and several definitions of medication exposure.
RESULTS: There were 39,678 patients with COPD that met the study inclusion 
criteria. Of them, 7,775 (19.6%) had received at least one statin drug dispensed 
in the exposure ascertainment window. There were 1,446 all-cause deaths recorded 
in the cohort in the 1-year period after exposure ascertainment. In multivariate 
analysis, the estimated hazard ratio (HR) for statin drug exposure was 0.79 
(95% CI, 0.68-0.92; P = .0016), suggesting a 21% reduction in the risk from 
statin drug use on all-cause mortality. For lung-related mortality, there was 
also a considerable reduction in the risk for all-cause mortality from statin 
drug use (HR, 0.55; 95% CI, 0.32-0.93; P = .0254). These results were robust to 
different specifications of the exposure ascertainment window.
CONCLUSIONS: This study shows that statin drug use in a population-based cohort 
of patients with COPD may confer benefits regarding reduced lung-related and 
all-cause mortality.

COPD is a chronic inflammatory disease of the lungs associated with an abnormal 
inflammatory response to noxious particles, the most prevalent of which is 
cigarette smoke. Studies have demonstrated that cigarette smoking is associated 
with activation of the bone marrow, and chronic smoking can lead to the 
inflammatory changes seen in COPD. Due to the inflammatory nature of the 
disease, medications affecting the inflammatory pathway may have clinical 
benefit and are being evaluated. One such class of medications, HMG-CoA 
reductase inhibitors, have been evaluated in the COPD population. Early studies 
have suggested that HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors have a variety of benefits in 
COPD including improvements in inflammatory markers, exacerbation rates, and 
mortality rates. However, the majority of this data comes from retrospective 
cohort studies, suggesting the need for randomized controlled trials. Recently, 
two randomized controlled trials, STATCOPE and RODEO, evaluated the benefit of 
HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors in the COPD population and found no benefit in 
exacerbation rates and vascular or pulmonary function, respectively. These 
results are reflected in practice guidelines, which do not support the use of 
HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors for the purpose of reducing COPD exacerbations.

BACKGROUND: Despite the recommendations of statins treatment for secondary 
prevention of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD), treatment 
adherence and persistence are still a concern. This study examined the real 
world practice of long-term adherence and persistence to statins treatment 
initiated after hospital discharge for ASCVD, and their associated factors in a 
nationwide cohort.
METHODS: Post discharge statin prescriptions between 2006 and 2012 were 
extracted from the Taiwan National Health Insurance claims database. Good 
adherence, defined as proportion of days covered (PDC) ≥0.8 and mean medication 
possession ratio (MPR), was measured every 180-day period. Non-persistence was 
defined on the date patients failed to refill statin for 90 days after the end 
of the last prescription. Their associations with influential factors were 
analyzed using a generalized estimating equation and Cox's proportional hazard 
model.
RESULTS: There was a total of 185,252 post-discharge statin initiations (from 
169,624 patients) and followed for 467,398 patient-years in the study cohort. 
Percentage of good adherence (mean MPR) was 71% (0.87) at 6-months; declined to 
54% (0.68), 47% (0.59), and 42% (0.50) at end of year 1, 2, and 7, respectively. 
Persistence in statin treatment was 86, 67, 50, and 25% at 6-month, 1-, 2-, and 
7-year, respectively. Comparing the statin-cohort initiated from year 2006 to 
2012, 1-year persistence increased from 58 to 73%, and 1-year good adherence 
improved from 45 to 61%. Factors associated with sub-optimal adherence and 
non-persistence included: prescription by primary care clinics or non-cardiology 
specialties; patients' age > 75 years; no history of previous statin use; ASCVD 
events with ischemic stroke diagnosis; comorbidities of renal disease, liver 
disease, depression, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
CONCLUSIONS: Despite the improving trends, long-term adherence and persistence 
of statin treatment were suboptimal in Taiwan. Strategies to maintain statin 
treatment adherence and persistence need to be implemented to further enhance 
the positive trend.

BACKGROUND: Despite recent studies that suggested statins' beneficial effects on 
chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) outcomes, the impact, if any, of 
statins on COPD exacerbations remains unclear. This study aimed to examine the 
association between statin use and risk of hospitalized COPD exacerbation, and 
to assess whether the association varied by statin initiation, dose, or duration 
of use.
METHODS: A retrospective nested case-control study among patients with COPD was 
conducted analyzing a nationwide health insurance claims database in Taiwan. 
Cases were subjects hospitalized for COPD exacerbations; each case was matched 
to 4 randomly selected controls on age, sex, cohort entry, and number of 
COPD-related outpatient visits by an incident-density sampling approach. 
Conditional logistic regressions were employed to quantify the COPD exacerbation 
risk associated with statin use.
RESULTS: The study cohort comprised 14,316 COPD patients, from which 1584 cases 
with COPD exacerbations and 5950 matched controls were identified. Any use of 
statins was associated with a 30% decreased risk of COPD exacerbation (95% 
confidence interval [CI], 0.56-0.88), and current use of statins was related to 
a greater reduced risk (adjusted odds ratio [OR] 0.60; 95% CI, 0.44-0.81). A 
dose-dependent reduced risk of COPD exacerbation by statins was observed (medium 
average daily dose: adjusted OR 0.60; 95% CI, 0.41-0.89; high daily dose: 
adjusted OR 0.33; 95% CI, 0.14-0.73). The reduced risk remained significant for 
either short or long duration of statin use.
CONCLUSIONS: Statin use was associated with a reduced risk of COPD exacerbation, 
with a further risk reduction for statins prescribed more recently or at high 
doses.

BACKGROUND: Although both chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and 
cardiovascular diseases (CVD) are characterised by chronic, systemic 
inflammation, their reciprocal interactions are poorly understood. The purpose 
of this study was to determine the concentrations of both inflammatory and 
oxidative stress biomarkers in the serum and exhaled breath condensate (EBC) of 
COPD patients, either with coexisting CVD or without cardio-vascular 
comorbidities.
METHODS: Twenty-four COPD patients with CVD were allocated to group A, 20 COPD 
patients without CVD were assigned to group B and 16 healthy patients were 
included as a control. A medical history and physical examination were 
performed, and the following were measured: serum CRP concentration, glucose 
level, uraemic acid level and lipid profile. In addition 8-isoprostane, LTB4 and 
IL-8 concentrations were measured both in serum and EBC. Spirometry, six-minute 
walk test and echocardiography were performed in all subjects.
RESULTS: EBC concentrations of 8-isoprostane and LTB4, and serum levels of CRP, 
8-soprostane, LTB4, IL-8 were significantly higher in COPD patients than in 
healthy controls. COPD patients with CVD were not found to have higher 
concentrations of the assessed markers than those without CVD, neither in the 
serum nor EBC. CRP, 8-isoprostane and LTB4 levels in serum, and IL-8 
concentration in EBC correlated negatively with the value of forced expiratory 
volume in one second.
CONCLUSIONS: Although systemic inflammation coexists with COPD, it is not 
elevated in COPD patients with CVD. Since this phenomenon may result from 
treatment with statins, future studies should state whether COPD patients could 
benefit from the additional statin therapy.

The Mevalonate Pathway and Innate Immune Hyper-Responsiveness in the 
Pathogenesis of COPD and Lung Cancer: Potential for Chemoprevention.

Current evidence suggests that persisting and/or exaggerated inflammation in the 
lungs initiated by smoking, and up-regulated through genetic susceptibility, may 
result in lung remodelling and impaired repair. The mevalonate pathway, through 
its modifying effects on innate immune responsiveness, may be involved in these 
processes providing a plausible pathogenic link between the development of 
chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and lung cancer. The mevalonate 
pathway, mediates these effects through important intra-cellular signalling 
molecules called guanine phosphate transferases (GTPases) such as Rho-A. Smoke 
exposure activates cell surface proteins which, through the mediating influence 
of GTPases, then modify the activation of NFkB and its downstream effects on 
genes underlying innate immunity, neutrophilic inflammation and carcinogenesis. 
The mevalonate pathway is readily and substantially modified by inhibition of 
the enzyme 3-hydroxy-3-methyl-glutaryl-Coenzyme A (HMGCo-A) reductase. This 
enzyme controls the rate limiting step of the mevalonate pathway and is subject 
to inhibition by statin drugs and small chain fatty acids derived from high 
dietary fibre intake. Thus inhibiting the mevelonate pathway, and dampening the 
innate immune response to smoking, may play a critical role in modifying 
pulmonary inflammation and lung remodelling. Such an action might slow the 
progression of COPD and reduce the tendency to the development of lung cancer. 
This review examines the pre-clinical and clinical data suggesting that 
HMGCoA-reductase inhibition and it's modification of the mevalonate pathway, may 
have a chemo-preventive effect on lung cancer, particularly in patients with 
COPD where pulmonary inflammation is increased and the risk of lung cancer is 
greatest.

AIM: of this study is to determine the temporal resolution of therapy-induced 
pneumonitis, and to assess promoting factors in adjuvant treated patients with 
unilateral mammacarcinoma.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 100 post-surgery patients were recruited. The 
cohort was treated by 2 field radiotherapy (2FRT; breast and chest wall, 
N = 75), 3 field radiotherapy (3FRT; + supraclavicular lymphatic region, N = 8), 
or with 4 field radiotherapy (4FRT; + parasternal lymphatic region, N = 17). 
Ninety-one patients received various systemic treatments prior to irradiation. 
Following an initial screening visit post-RT, two additional visits after 12 and 
25 weeks were conducted including radiographic examination. In addition, general 
anamnesis and the co-medication were recorded. The endpoint was reached as soon 
as a pneumonitis was developed or at maximum of six months post-treatment.
RESULTS: A pneumonitis incidence of 13% was determined. Of 91 patients with 
prior systemic therapy, 11 patients developed pneumonitis. Smoking history and 
chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) appeared to be positive predictors, 
whereas past pneumonia clearly promoted pneumonitis. Further 
pneumonitis-promoting predictors are represented by the applied field extensions 
(2 field radiotherapy [2FRT] < 3 field radiotherapy [3FRT] < 4 field 
radiotherapy [4FRT]) and the type of combined initial systemic therapies. As a 
consequence, all of the three patients in the study cohort treated with 4FRT and 
initial chemotherapy combined with anti-hormone and antibody protocols developed 
pneumonitis. A combination of the hormone antagonists tamoxifen and goserelin 
might enhance the risk for pneumonitis. Remarkably, none of the 11 patients 
co-medicated with statins suffered from pneumonitis.
CONCLUSIONS: The rapidly increasing use of novel systemic therapy schedules 
combined with radiotherapy (RT) needs more prospective studies with larger 
cohorts. Our results indicate that contribution to pneumonitis occurrence of 
various (neo)adjuvant therapy approaches followed by RT is of minor relevance, 
whereas mean total lung doses of >10 Gy escalate the risk of lung tissue 
complications. The validity of potential inhibitors of therapy-induced 
pneumonitis as observed for statin co-medication should further be investigated 
in future trials.

ZIELSETZUNG: Erfassen von therapieinduzierten Pneumonitisfällen und von 
begünstigenden Faktoren bei adjuvant bestrahlten Patientinnen mit einseitigem 
Mammakarzinom.
PATIENTEN UND METHODEN: Es wurden 100 Patientinnen post-resektiv eingeschlossen. 
Die Kohorte wurde mittels „2 field radiotherapy“ (2FRT; Brust und Brustwand, 
N = 75), 3FRT (+supraklavikuläre Lymphknotenregion, N = 8), oder mittels 4FRT 
(+Parasternalregion, N = 17) behandelt. 91 Patientinnen erhielten vorausgehend 
unterschiedliche systemische Protokolle. Nach der initialen Screeningvisite 
post-RT folgten noch Kontrollvisiten im Abstand von 12 und 25 Wochen inklusive 
Bildgebung. Daneben wurden die Anamnese sowie die Co-Medikation erhoben. Der 
Endpunkt wurde mit Auftreten der Pneumonitis oder maximal nach sechs Monaten 
erreicht.
ERGEBNISSE: Die Pneumonitis-Häufigkeit lag bei 13  %. Von 91 Patientinnen mit 
vorausgegangener systemischer Therapie entwickelten 11 Patientinnen eine 
Pneumonitis. Rauchen und „chronic obstructive pulmonary disease“ (COPD) zeigten 
sich als tendenziell positive Prädiktoren, eine Pneumonie-Historie als negativer 
Faktor, genauso wie Felderweiterungen (2FRT < 3FRT < 4FRT) und das Ausmaß der 
vorangegangenen systemischen Kombinationstherapien. So entwickelten alle 
3 Patientinnen mit 4FRT und vorausgegangener Chemotherapie plus Hormon- und 
Antikörpertherapie eine Pneumonitis. Eine Kombination aus den beiden 
Hormonantagonisten Tamoxifen und Goserelin scheint das Pneumonitisrisiko zu 
verstärken. Bemerkenswert ist, dass von 11 Patientinnen mit einer 
Statin-Comedikation keine an einer Pneumonitis erkrankt ist.
SCHLUSSFOLGERUNG: Wegen der Zunahme an Kombinationstherapien bei 
Mammakarzinom-Patientinnen sollten größere Studien durchgeführt werden. Die 
Ergebnisse zeigen einen kaum relevanten Beitrag der (neo)adjuvanten Therapien 
zur beobachteten Pneumonitisinzidenz, während eine mittlere Lungendosis von >10 
Gy das Risiko einer Lungenkomplikation stark erhöht. Die Bedeutung von 
potenziellen Pneumonitis-Inhibitoren, wie zum Beispiel Statinen, sollte in 
weiteren Studien gezielt überprüft werden.

AIMS: To determine whether beta-blockers, aspirin, and statins are underutilized 
after first-time myocardial infarction (MI) in patients with chronic obstructive 
pulmonary disease (COPD) compared with patients without COPD. Further, to 
determine temporal trends and risk factors for non-use.
METHODS AND RESULTS: Using Danish nationwide registers, we performed a 
cross-sectional study investigating the utilization of beta-blockers, aspirin, 
and statins after hospitalization for first-time MI among patients with and 
without COPD from 1995 to 2015. Risk factors for non-use were examined in 
multivariable logistic regression models. During 21 years of study, 140 278 
patients were included, hereof 13 496 (9.6%) with COPD. Patients with COPD were 
less likely to use beta-blockers (53.2% vs. 76.2%, P < 0.001), aspirin (73.9% 
vs. 78.8%, P < 0.001), and statins (53.5% vs. 61.9%, P < 0.001). Medication 
usage increased during the study period but in multivariable analyses, COPD 
remained a significant predictor for non-use: odds ratio (95% confidence 
interval) for non-use of beta-blockers 1.86 (1.76-1.97); aspirin 1.24 
(1.16-1.32); statins 1.50 (1.41-1.59). Analyses stratified by ST-segment 
elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) and non-STEMI showed similar 
undertreatment of COPD patients. Risk factors for non-use of beta-blockers in 
COPD included increasing age, female sex, and increasing severity of COPD 
(frequent exacerbations, use of multiple inhaled medications, and low lung 
function). Similar findings were demonstrated for aspirin and statins.
CONCLUSION: Beta-blockers, and to a lesser extent aspirin and statins, were 
systematically underutilized by patients with COPD following hospitalization for 
MI despite an overall increase in the utilization over time. Increasing severity 
of COPD was a risk factor for non-use of the medications.

RATIONALE: Evidence linking traffic-related particle exposure to systemic 
effects in chronic obstructive lung disease (COPD) patients is limited.
OBJECTIVES: Assess relationships between indoor black carbon (BC), a tracer of 
traffic-related particles, and plasma biomarkers of systemic inflammation and 
endothelial activation.
METHODS: BC was measured by reflectance in fine particle samples over a mean of 
7.6 days in homes of 85 COPD patients up to 4 times seasonally over a year. 
After the completion of sampling, plasma C-reactive protein (CRP), interleukin-6 
(IL-6), and soluble vascular adhesion molecule-1 (sVCAM-1) were measured. 
Current smokers and homes with major sources of BC were excluded; therefore, 
indoor BC was primarily a measure of infiltrated outdoor BC. Mixed effects 
regression models with a random intercept for each participant were used to 
assess BC effects at different times (1-9 days before phlebotomy) and in the 
multi-day sample.
RESULTS: Measured median BC was 0.19 µg/m3 (interquartile range, 
IQR=0.22 µg/m3). Adjusting for season, race, age, BMI, heart disease, diabetes, 
ambient temperature, relative humidity, a recent cold or similar illness, and 
blood draw time, there was a positive relationship between BC and CRP. The 
largest effect size was for BC averaged over the previous seven days (11.8% 
increase in CRP per IQR; 95%CI = 1.8-22.9). Effects were greatest among 
non-statin users and persons with diabetes. There were positive effects of BC on 
IL-6 only in non-statin users. There were no associations with sVCAM-1.
CONCLUSIONS: These results demonstrate exposure-response relationships between 
indoor BC with biomarkers of systemic inflammation in COPD patients, with 
stronger relationships in persons not using statins and with diabetes.

BACKGROUND: Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a common, 
preventable, and treatable respiratory disease. COPD exacerbations are 
associated with worse quality of life, increased hospitalisations, and increased 
mortality. Currently available pharmacological interventions have variable 
impact on exacerbation frequency. The anti-inflammatory effects of statins may 
lead to decreased pulmonary and systemic inflammation, resulting in fewer 
exacerbations of COPD. Several observational studies have shown potential 
benefits of statins for patients with COPD.
OBJECTIVES: This review aims to evaluate available evidence on benefits and 
harms associated with statin therapy compared with placebo as adjunct therapy 
for patients with COPD. Primary objectives include the following.• To determine 
whether statins reduce mortality rates in COPD.• To determine whether statins 
reduce exacerbation frequency, improve quality of life, or improve lung function 
in COPD.• To determine whether statins are associated with adverse effects.
SEARCH METHODS: We identified trials from the Cochrane Airways Trials Register, 
which contains studies identified through multiple electronic searches and 
handsearches of other sources. We also searched trial registries and reference 
lists of primary studies. We conducted the most recent search on 20 May 2019.
SELECTION CRITERIA: Parallel, randomised controlled trials recruiting adults 
with COPD.
DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: We used standard methods as expected by Cochrane. 
Prespecified primary outcomes were number of exacerbations, all-cause mortality, 
and COPD-specific mortality.
MAIN RESULTS: Eight studies including 1323 participants with COPD were included 
in the review. Participants had a mean age of 61.4 to 72 years, and most were 
male (median 73.4%). Mean baseline forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV₁) 
ranged from 41% to 90% predicted. All studies compared moderate- or 
high-intensity statin therapy versus placebo. The duration of treatment ranged 
from 12 weeks to 36 months.We found no statistically significant difference 
between statins and placebo in our primary outcome of number of exacerbations 
per person-year (mean difference (MD) -0.03, 95% confidence interval (CI) -0.25 
to 0.19, 1 trial, 877 participants), including number of exacerbations requiring 
hospitalisation per person-year (MD 0.00, 95% CI -0.10 to 0.10, 1 trial, 877 
exacerbations). This evidence was of moderate quality after downgrading for 
unclear risk of bias. Our primary outcomes of all-cause mortality (odds ratio 
(OR) 1.03, 95% CI 0.61 to 1.74, 2 trials, 952 participants) and COPD-specific 
mortality (OR 1.25, 95% CI 0.38 to 4.13, 1 trial, 877 participants) showed no 
significant difference between statins and placebo, with wide confidence 
intervals suggesting uncertainty about the precision of the results. This 
evidence was of low quality after downgrading for unclear risk of bias and 
imprecision.Results of the secondary outcomes analysis showed no clear 
differences between statins and placebo for FEV₁ (% predicted) (MD 1.18, 95% CI 
-2.6 to 4.97, 6 trials, 325 participants) but did show a statistically 
significant improvement in FEV₁/forced vital capacity (FVC) (MD 2.66, 95% CI 
0.12 to 5.2; P = 0.04; 6 trials, 325 participants). A sensitivity analysis 
excluding two trials at high risk of bias showed no statistically significant 
difference in FEV₁/FVC (MD 2.05, 95% CI -0.87 to -4.97; P = 0.17; 4 trials, 255 
participants). We also found no significant differences between the two groups 
in functional capacity measured by six-minute walk distance in metres (MD 1.79, 
95% CI -52.51 to 56.09, 3 trials, 71 participants), with wide confidence 
intervals suggesting uncertainty about the precision of the results. Results 
show no clear difference in quality of life, which was reported in three trials, 
and a slight reduction in C-reactive protein (CRP) in the intervention group, 
which was statistically significant (MD -1.03, 95% CI -1.95 to -0.11; I² = 0%, P 
= 0.03; 3 trials, 142 participants). We noted a significant reduction in 
interleukin (IL)-6 in the intervention group (MD -2.11, 95% CI -2.65 to -1.56; 
I² = 0%, P ≤ 0.00001; 2 trials, 125 participants). All trials mentioned adverse 
events and indicated that statins were generally well tolerated. One study 
reported adverse events in detail and indicated that rates of all non-fatal 
adverse events (the number of serious adverse events per person-year) were 
similar in both groups (0.63 ± 1.56 events (intervention group) and 0.62 ± 1.48 
events (control group); P > 0.20) for all comparisons, except for non-fatal 
serious adverse events involving the gastrointestinal tract, which were more 
frequent in the intervention group (in 30 patients (0.05 events per person-year) 
vs 17 patients (0.02 events per person-year); P = 0.02). Another trial lists the 
total numbers and percentages of adverse events in the intervention group (12 
(26%)) and in the control group (21 (43%)) and of serious adverse events in the 
intervention group (4 (9%)) and in the control group (3 (6%)).The other trials 
stated that researchers found no significant adverse effects of statins but did 
not report adverse events in detail.
AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: A small number of trials providing low- or 
moderate-quality evidence were suitable for inclusion in this review. They 
showed that use of statins resulted in a reduction in CRP and IL-6, but that 
this did not translate into clear clinical benefit for people with COPD. Further 
randomised controlled trials are needed to explore this topic.

BACKGROUND: Statins have anti-inflammatory and immunomodulating properties which 
could possibly influence inflammatory airways disease. We assessed evidence for 
disease modifying effects of statin treatment in patients with chronic 
obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).
METHODS: A systematic review was conducted of studies which reported effects of 
statin treatment in COPD. Data sources searched included MEDLINE, EMBASE and 
reference lists.
RESULTS: Eight papers reporting nine original studies met the selection 
criteria. One was a randomized controlled trial (RCT), one a retrospective 
nested case-control study, five were retrospective cohort studies of which one 
was linked with a case-control study, and one was a retrospective 
population-based analysis. Outcomes associated with treatment with statins 
included decreased all-cause mortality in three out of four studies (OR/HR 
0.48-0.67 in three studies, OR 0.99 in one study), decreased COPD-related 
mortality (OR 0.19-0.29), reduction in incidence of respiratory-related urgent 
care (OR 0.74), fewer COPD exacerbations (OR 0.43), fewer intubations for COPD 
exacerbations (OR 0.1) and attenuated decline in pulmonary function. The RCT 
reported improvement in exercise capacity and dyspnea after exercise associated 
with decreased levels of C-reactive protein and Interleukin-6 in statin users, 
but no improvement of lung function.
CONCLUSION: There is evidence from observational studies and one RCT that 
statins may reduce morbidity and/or mortality in COPD patients. Further 
interventional studies are required to confirm these findings.

OBJECTIVES: Carotid artery endarterectomy (CEA) and carotid artery stenting 
(CAS) are 2 effective treatment options for carotid revascularization and stroke 
prevention. The long-term outcomes of Carotid Revascularization Endarterectomy 
versus Stenting Trial (CREST) reported similar stroke and death rate between the 
2 procedures. This study presents the short- and long-term outcomes of CEA and 
CAS of all risk patients performed by a single vascular surgeon in a real-world 
setting.
METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed all patients who underwent CEA and CAS from 
September 2005 to June 2017 at our institute. Student t test, χ2, and Fisher 
exact tests were used to compare patient's characteristics. Multivariate 
logistic, cox regression models and survival analysis were used to compare 
postoperative and long-term outcomes between the 2 groups.
RESULTS: Over 2000 patients were evaluated for carotid artery stenosis during 
the study period, and 313 revascularization procedures were performed (CEA: 47%, 
CAS: 53%). Patients' age (Mean [95% confidence interval, CI] 68.8 [67.2-70.4] vs 
69.7 [68.2-71.3], P = .40) was similar between CEA and CAS. Patients who 
underwent CAS had significantly higher comorbidities (chronic obstructive 
pulmonary disease [COPD], chronic heart failure [CHF], hyperlipidemia, and prior 
ipsilateral intervention, all P < .05). No difference was found in 30-day 
complications after CEA versus CAS including stroke (2.0% vs 1.2%), myocardial 
infarction (MI; 0.7% vs 1.2%), death (0% vs 1.2%) as well as combined major 
adverse events (stroke/death/MI; 2.7% vs 3.0%; all P > .05). Overall 7-year 
survival, stroke-free survival and restenosis-free survival were similar between 
the 2 groups ( P > .5). Significant predictors of mortality were diabetes 
(hazard ratio, HR [95% CI]: 2.41 [1.15-5.08]), chronic kidney disease (HR [95% 
CI]: 4.89 [1.97-12.13]), and COPD (HR [95% CI]: 3.31 [1.43-7.71]; all P values 
<.05). Statin use was protective with 71% reduction in risk of mortality (HR 
[95% CI]: 0.29 [0.12-0.67], P = .004).
CONCLUSION: Our experience showed comparable short- and long-term outcomes of 
CAS and CEA performed for carotid artery stenosis by vascular surgeon. There was 
no difference between single institutional long-term outcomes and CREST outcomes 
following CEA and CAS.

BACKGROUND: Rates of emergency hospitalisations are increasing in many 
countries, leading to disruption in the quality of care and increases in cost. 
Therefore, identifying strategies to reduce emergency admission rates is a key 
priority. There have been large-scale evidence reviews to address this issue; 
however, there have been no reviews of medication therapies, which have the 
potential to reduce the use of emergency health-care services. The objectives of 
this study were to review systematically the evidence to identify medications 
that affect emergency hospital admissions and prioritise therapies for quality 
measurement and improvement.
METHODS: This was a systematic review of systematic reviews. We searched 
MEDLINE, PubMed, the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews & Database of 
Abstracts of Reviews of Effects, Google Scholar and the websites of ten major 
funding agencies and health charities, using broad search criteria. We included 
systematic reviews of randomised controlled trials that examined the effect of 
any medication on emergency hospital admissions among adults. We assessed the 
quality of reviews using AMSTAR. To prioritise therapies, we assessed the 
quality of trial evidence underpinning meta-analysed effect estimates and 
cross-referenced the evidence with clinical guidelines.
RESULTS: We identified 140 systematic reviews, which included 1968 unique 
randomised controlled trials and 925,364 patients. Reviews contained 100 
medications tested in 47 populations. We identified high-to moderate-quality 
evidence for 28 medications that reduced admissions. Of these medications, 11 
were supported by clinical guidelines in the United States, the United Kingdom 
and Europe. These 11 therapies were for patients with heart failure 
(angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor blockers, 
aldosterone receptor antagonists and digoxin), stable coronary artery disease 
(intensive statin therapy), asthma exacerbations (early inhaled corticosteroids 
in the emergency department and anticholinergics), chronic obstructive pulmonary 
disease (long-acting muscarinic antagonists and long-acting beta-2 adrenoceptor 
agonists) and schizophrenia (second-generation antipsychotics and 
depot/maintenance antipsychotics).
CONCLUSIONS: We identified 11 medications supported by strong evidence and 
clinical guidelines that could be considered in quality monitoring and 
improvement strategies to help reduce emergency hospital admission rates. The 
findings are relevant to health systems with a large burden of chronic disease 
and those managing increasing pressures on acute health-care services.

Sedentary behavior has emerged as an independent cardiovascular disease risk 
factor. Uncertainty exists about the behaviors of statin users, who may exhibit 
either a healthy adherer or a false reassurance effect. We conducted this study 
in order to assess and compare TV viewing among statin users and nonusers. We 
used data from a cross-sectional study of 12,754 participants, from south-east 
Poland, age 45 to 64 years in 2010-11. Statin use during last 30 days was 
recorded by trained nurses. Participants reported time spent viewing TV/week. 
There were 1728 (13.5%) statin users of which 628 (36.34%) had cardiovascular 
diseases. The prevalence of viewing TV ≥ 21 h/week was higher among statin users 
(29.72%) compared to non-users (23.10%) and remained 15% higher after adjusting 
for age, sex, education, smoking, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and 
other chronic diseases (prevalence ratio, PR 1.15, 95% CI 1.06 to 1.25). We 
found a similar pattern in both those with and without prevalent cardiovascular 
disease. In conclusion, we found a higher prevalence of prolonged TV-viewing 
among statin users than non-users. Future studies are needed to explore 
innovative behavioral interventions and patient counseling strategies to reduce 
TV viewing among statin users.

of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.

BACKGROUND: A paradoxical association between cholesterol level and clinical 
outcome has been suggested, yet never previously established, in patients with 
chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).
OBJECTIVES: The authors sought to investigate the interaction between long-term 
survival, lipid profile and statin use in patients after acute exacerbation of 
COPD (AECOPD).
METHODS: A retrospective study evaluating demographic, clinical and laboratory 
data of 615 consecutive patients admitted for AECOPD over a mean follow-up 
period of 24.8 months. Kaplan-Meier survival curves and multivariate analysis 
were used to identify independent prognostic predictors for all-cause mortality.
RESULTS: Mean ± standard deviation (SD) age of the study population was 71.8 ± 
11.4 years. Unexpectedly, mean serum cholesterol ± SD levels were significantly 
higher in survivors (N = 340) versus nonsurvivors (N = 275): 181.5 ± 43.6 versus 
171.6 ± 57.2 mg/dL, respectively, (P = 0.0043). Median survival for patients 
with cholesterol levels <150 and >200 mg/dL were 16.0 and 64.4 months, 
respectively (P = 0.0173). On multivariate analysis, cholesterol level <150 
mg/dL was an independent predictor of mortality, irrespective of cardiovascular 
risk factors (hazard ratio [HR] = 1.8430, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 
1.2547-2.7072, P = 0.0019). Statin use had an independent protective effect, 
regardless of cholesterol level (HR = 0.4924, 95% CI = 0.2924-0.8292, P = 
0.0080).
CONCLUSIONS: Low cholesterol levels are significantly associated with increased 
mortality after AECOPD. Nonetheless, as statin treatment was associated with 
reduced mortality over the entire range of cholesterol levels, its use should be 
considered in all COPD patients.

OBJECTIVE: Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is the fourth leading 
cause of death in the United States but is often undertreated. COPD often 
overlaps with other conditions such as hypertension and osteoporosis, which are 
less morbid but may be treated more aggressively. We evaluated the prevalence of 
these comorbid conditions and compared testing, patient knowledge, and 
management in a national sample of patients with COPD.
METHODS: A survey was administered by telephone in 2006 to 1003 patients with 
COPD to evaluate the prevalence of comorbid conditions, diagnostic testing, 
knowledge, and management using standardized instruments. The completion rate 
was 87%.
RESULTS: Among 1003 patients with COPD, 61% reported moderate or severe dyspnea 
and 41% reported a prior hospitalization for COPD. The most prevalent comorbid 
diagnoses were hypertension (55%), hypercholesterolemia (52%), depression (37%), 
cataracts (31%), and osteoporosis (28%). Only 10% of respondents knew their 
forced expiratory volume in 1 second (95% confidence interval [CI], 8-12) 
compared with 79% who knew their blood pressure (95% CI, 76-83). Seventy-two 
percent (95% CI, 69-75) reported taking any medication for COPD, usually a 
short-acting bronchodilator, whereas 87% (95% CI, 84-90) of patients with COPD 
and hypertension were taking an antihypertensive medication and 72% (95% CI, 
68-75) of patients with COPD and hypercholesterolemia were taking a statin.
CONCLUSION: Although most patients with COPD in this national sample were 
symptomatic and many had been hospitalized for COPD, COPD self-knowledge was low 
and COPD was undertreated compared with generally asymptomatic, less morbid 
conditions such as hypertension.

BACKGROUND: Patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) are at a 
higher risk of many types of cancer. However, specific investigation of the risk 
of prostate cancer and the influence of COPD pharmacotherapy in patients with 
COPD is lacking. This study investigated the risk and influence of COPD 
pharmacotherapy on risk of prostate cancer in patients with COPD.
METHODS: This retrospective cohort study used data from Taiwan's Longitudinal 
Health Insurance Database 2005 (LHID2005). The study cohort comprised COPD 
patients who received treatment between 2004 and 2008, and who were identified 
from the LHID2005. The control cohort comprised patients without COPD and was 
matched to the study cohort by age and sex. Two-stage propensity score 
calibration with the National Health Interview Survey 2005 was performed to 
obtain the missing confounders of smoking, alcohol drinking, and body mass index 
in the LHID. The hazard ratio (HR) and adjusted HR were estimated. Moreover, the 
influence of inhaled medications and other related medication on the risk of 
prostate cancer was analyzed by Cox proportional hazard regression.
RESULTS: The COPD cohort comprised 12,774 patients, and the control cohort 
comprised 38,322 patients (1:3). The incidence of prostate cancer was 633 per 
100,000 person-years in the COPD cohort and 361 per 100,000 person-years in the 
control cohort. The propensity score calibration-adjusted HR was 1.62 (95% CI, 
1.40-1.87, p < 0.001) in the COPD cohort. Further analysis revealed that the 
adjusted HR for the risk of prostate cancer was 1.61 (95% CI, 1.19-2.16, p = 
0.002) in patients with COPD who used short-acting muscarinic antagonists 
(SAMAs) and 1.89 (95% CI, 1.40-2.54, p < 0.001) in patients with COPD who used 
short-acting beta-agonists (SABAs). COPD patients had lower risk of prostate 
cancer when using statin (HR = 0.63, 95% CI, 0.45-0.89, p = 0.010) or aspirin 
(HR = 0.55, 95% CI, 0.35-0.85, p = 0.008).
CONCLUSION: Patients with COPD are at a higher risk of prostate cancer, 
particularly those using SAMAs or SABAs. This finding suggests that inflammation 
control may be an effective strategy for decreasing the risk of prostate cancer.

BACKGROUND: Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is associated with an 
increased risk of lung cancer, independently of smoking. However, the 
relationship between COPD and total cancer mortality is less certain. A study 
was undertaken to investigate the association between COPD and total cancer 
mortality and to determine whether the use of statins, which have been 
associated with cancer risk in other settings, modified this relationship.
METHODS: The study included 3371 patients with peripheral arterial disease who 
underwent vascular surgery between 1990 and 2006; 1310 (39%) had COPD and the 
rest did not. The primary end point was cancer mortality (lung and 
extrapulmonary) over a median follow-up of 5 years.
RESULTS: COPD was associated with an increased risk of both lung cancer 
mortality (hazard ratio (HR) 2.06; 95% CI 1.32 to 3.20) and extrapulmonary 
cancer mortality (HR 1.43; 95% CI 1.06 to 1.94). The excess risk was mostly 
driven by patients with moderate and severe COPD. There was a trend towards a 
lower risk of cancer mortality among patients with COPD who used statins 
compared with patients with COPD who did not use statins (HR 0.57; 95% CI 0.32 
to 1.01). Interestingly, the risk of extrapulmonary cancer mortality was lower 
among statin users with COPD (HR 0.49; 95% CI 0.24 to 0.99).
CONCLUSIONS: COPD was associated with increased lung and extrapulmonary cancer 
mortality in this large cohort of patients with peripheral arterial disease 
undergoing vascular surgery. The risk of lung cancer mortality increased with 
progression of COPD. Statins were associated with a reduced risk of 
extrapulmonary cancer mortality in patients with COPD.

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and peripheral arterial disease 
(PAD) are both inflammatory conditions. Statins are commonly used in patients 
with PAD and have anti-inflammatory properties, which may have beneficial 
effects in patients with COPD. The relation between statin use and mortality was 
investigated in patients with PAD with and without COPD. From 1990 to 2006, we 
studied 3,371 vascular surgery patients. Statin use was noted at baseline and, 
if prescribed, converted to <25% (low dose) and > or =25% (intensified dose) of 
the maximum recommended therapeutic dose. The diagnosis of COPD was based on the 
Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease guidelines using 
pulmonary function test. End points were short- (30-day) and long-term (10-year) 
mortality. A total of 330 patients with COPD (25%) used statins, and 480 
patients (23%) without COPD. Statin use was independently associated with 
improved short- and long-term survival in patients with COPD (odds ratio 0.48, 
95% confidence interval [CI] 0.23 to 1.00; hazard ratio 0.67, 95% CI 0.52 to 
0.86, respectively). In patients without COPD, statins were also associated with 
improved short- and long-term survival (odds ratio 0.42, 95% CI 0.20 to 0.87; 
hazard ratio 0.76, 95% CI 0.60 to 0.95, respectively). In patients with COPD, 
only an intensified dose of statins was associated with improved short-term 
survival. However, for the long term, both low-dose and intensive statin therapy 
were beneficial. In conclusion, statin use was associated with improved short- 
and long-term survival in patients with PAD with and without COPD. Patients with 
COPD should be treated with an intensified dose of statins to achieve an optimal 
effect on both the short and long term.

BACKGROUND: People living with HIV-1 infection are at greater risk for 
cardiovascular disease than seronegative adults. Treatment of dyslipidaemia with 
statins has been challenging in people with HIV because of an increased 
potential for drug interactions due to competing cytochrome P450 metabolism 
between statins and commonly used antiretroviral agents. Neither pitavastatin 
nor pravastatin depend on cytochrome P450 for primary metabolism. We aimed to 
assess the safety and efficacy of pitavastatin versus pravastatin in adults with 
HIV and dyslipidaemia.
METHODS: In the INTREPID (HIV-infected patieNts and TREatment with PItavastatin 
vs pravastatin for Dyslipidemia) randomised, double-blind, active-controlled, 
phase 4 trial (INTREPID, we recruited adults aged 18-70 years with controlled 
HIV (with CD4 counts >200 cells per μL and HIV-1 RNA <200 copies per mL) on 
antiretroviral therapy for at least 6 months and dyslipidaemia (LDL cholesterol 
3·4-5·7 mmol/L and triglycerides ≤4·5 mmol/L) from 45 sites in the USA and 
Puerto Rico. Patients being treated with darunavir, or who had homozygous 
familial hypercholesterolaemia or any condition causing secondary dyslipidaemia, 
or a history of statin intolerance, diabetes, or coronary artery disease were 
not eligible. We randomly assigned patients (1:1) to pitavastatin 4 mg or 
pravastatin 40 mg with matching placebos once daily orally for 12 weeks, 
followed by a 40 week safety extension. Randomisation was stratified by viral 
hepatitis B or C coinfection and computer-generated. Investigators, patients, 
study staff, and those assessing outcomes were masked to treatment group. The 
primary endpoint was percentage change in fasting serum LDL cholesterol from 
baseline to week 12 and the primary efficacy analysis was done in the modified 
intention-to-treat population. The safety analysis included all patients who 
took at least one dose of study medication. This study is registered with 
ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01301066.
FINDINGS: Between Feb 23, 2011, and March 29, 2013, we randomly assigned 252 
patients to the pitavastatin (n=126) or pravastatin group (n=126). LDL 
cholesterol reduction was 31·1% with pitavastatin and 20·9% with pravastatin 
(least squares mean difference -9·8%, 95% CI -13·8 to -5·9; p<0·0001) at 12 
weeks. At week 52, four patients (3%) in the pitavastatin group and six (5%) in 
the pravastatin group had virological failure, with no significant difference 
between treatments. Both treatments had neutral effects on glucose metabolism 
parameters. 85 patients treated with pitavastatin (68%) and 88 patients treated 
with pravastatin (70%) reported treatment-emergent adverse events, and these 
caused study discontinuation in six patients (5%) versus five patients (4%). No 
serious adverse event occurred in more than one participant and none were 
treatment-related according to investigator assessment. The most common 
treatment-emergent adverse events were diarrhoea in the pitavastatin group 
(n=12, 10%) and upper respiratory tract infection in the pravastatin group 
(n=14, 11%). 11 treatment-emergent serious adverse events were noted in seven 
patients (6%) in the pitavastatin group (atrial septal defect, chronic 
obstructive pulmonary disease, chest pain, diverticulitis, enterovesical 
fistula, gastroenteritis, viral gastroenteritis, herpes dermatitis, multiple 
fractures, respiratory failure, and transient ischaemic attack) and four events 
in three patients (2%) in the pravastatin group (cerebrovascular accident, 
arteriosclerosis coronary artery, myocardial infraction, and muscle 
haemorrhage). In the pravastatin treatment group, one additional patient 
discontinued due to an adverse event (prostate cancer that was diagnosed during 
the screening period, 42 days before first dose of study treatment, and 
therefore was not a treatment-emergent adverse event).
INTERPRETATION: The INTREPID results support guideline recommendations for 
pitavastatin as a preferred drug in the treatment of dyslipidaemia in people 
with HIV.

The role of statins in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease: is cardiovascular 
disease the common denominator?

Amariei DE(1), Reed RM.

(1)Division of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine, University of Maryland 
School of Medicine, Baltimore, USA.

PURPOSE OF REVIEW: The pleiotropic anti-inflammatory effects of statins that 
have proven to improve outcomes in cardiovascular disease have also been of 
interest in the treatment of COPD, a disease with considerable morbidity and 
little available treatment that improves mortality. In-vitro and animal studies 
have supported biologic plausibility of statin therapy for lung health and 
function. Retrospective observational studies in humans have echoed this 
potential as well but confirmatory data from randomized studies are limited and 
somewhat disappointing.
RECENT FINDINGS: Despite discouraging clinical trial results, the possibility 
remains that statins can help patients with COPD characterized by systemic 
inflammation. At the same time, increasing recognition of the considerable 
cardiovascular disease burden and its suboptimal treatment in patients with COPD 
has also contributed to continued enthusiasm for statin use in COPD.
SUMMARY: When it comes to defining the role for statins as a disease-modifying 
therapy, the jury is still out; however, the importance of more careful 
cardiovascular risk stratification that includes assessing levels of 
inflammatory markers in patients with COPD and the benefit of statins in those 
with increased risk is gaining increasing recognition.

Simvastatin Suppresses Airway IL-17 and Upregulates IL-10 in Patients With 
Stable COPD.

Maneechotesuwan K, Wongkajornsilp A, Adcock IM, Barnes PJ.

BACKGROUND: Statins have immunomodulatory properties that may provide beneficial 
effects in the treatment of COPD. We investigated whether a statin improves the 
IL-17/IL-10 imbalance in patients with COPD, as has previously been demonstrated 
in patients with asthma.
METHODS: Thirty patients with stable COPD were recruited to a double-blind, 
randomized, controlled, crossover trial comparing the effect of simvastatin, 20 
mg po daily, with that of a matched placebo on sputum inflammatory markers and 
airway inflammation. Each treatment was administered for 4 weeks separated by a 
4-week washout period. The primary outcome was the presence of T-helper 17 
cytokines and indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO) in induced sputum. Secondary 
outcomes included sputum inflammatory cells, FEV1, and symptoms using the COPD 
Assessment Test (CAT).
RESULTS: At 4 weeks, there was a significant reduction in sputum IL-17A, IL-22, 
IL-6, and CXCL8 concentrations (mean difference, -16.4 pg/mL, P = .01; -48.6 
pg/mL, P < .001; -45.3 pg/mL, P = .002; and -190.9 pg/mL, P = .007, 
respectively), whereas IL-10 concentrations, IDO messenger RNA expression (fold 
change), and IDO activity (kynurenine to tryptophan ratio) were markedly 
increased during simvastatin treatment compared with placebo treatment periods 
(mean difference, 24.7 pg/mL, P < .001; 1.02, P < .001; and 0.47, P < .001, 
respectively). The absolute sputum macrophage count, proportion of macrophages, 
and CAT score were reduced after simvastatin compared with placebo (mean 
difference, -0.16 × 106, P = .004; -14.1%, P < .001; and -3.2, P = .02, 
respectively). Values for other clinical outcomes were similar between the 
simvastatin and placebo treatments.
CONCLUSIONS: Simvastatin reversed the IL-17A/IL-10 imbalance in the airways and 
reduced sputum macrophage but not neutrophil counts in patients with COPD.

AIMS: To assess whether statin use is associated with reduced mortality in 
patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).
METHODS: Hospitalisation, drug dispensing, and mortality records were linked for 
New Zealanders aged 50-80 years discharged from hospital with a first admission 
with COPD in 2006. Patients were classified according to whether or not they 
were prescribed statins prior to admission. Baseline characteristics were 
compared and hazard ratios calculated for statin users versus statin non-users 
for all-cause mortality over follow-up of up to 4 years.
RESULTS: A total of 1,687 patients (mean age 70.6 years) were followed, 
including 596 statin users and 1,091 non-users. There were more men in the 
statin user group (58.4% vs. 48.5%), and statin users were more likely to have a 
history of cardiovascular disease (58.6% vs. 25.1%), prescription for frusemide 
as a proxy for heart failure (47.7% vs. 24.5%) or diabetes (35.4% vs.11.6%) than 
statin non-users (p<0.001). A total of 671 deaths occurred during the follow-up 
period. After adjustment for age, sex, ethnic group, history of cardiovascular 
disease, diabetes, and prescription for frusemide, the hazard ratio for statin 
users vs. statin non-users for all-cause mortality was 0.69 (95% CI 0.58 to 
0.84).
CONCLUSIONS: Statin use is associated with a 30% reduction in all-cause 
mortality at 3-4 years after first admission for COPD, irrespective of a past 
history of cardiovascular disease and diabetes.

BACKGROUND: Pulmonary hypertension (PH) in COPD carries a poor prognosis. Statin 
therapy has been associated with numerous beneficial clinical effects in COPD, 
including a possible improvement in PH. We examined the association between 
statin use and pulmonary hemodynamics in a well-characterized cohort of patients 
undergoing evaluation for lung transplantation.
METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional analysis of 112 subjects evaluated for 
lung transplant with a diagnosis of COPD. Clinical characteristics, pulmonary 
function, cardiac catheterization findings and medical comorbidities were 
compared between statins users and non-users.
RESULTS: Thirty-four (30%) subjects were receiving statin therapy. Statin users 
were older and had an increased prevalence of systemic hypertension and coronary 
artery disease (CAD). Mean pulmonary arterial pressure (mPAP) in the statin 
group was lower [26 ± 7 vs 29 ± 7 mmHg, p = 0.02], as was pulmonary artery wedge 
pressure (PAWP) [12 ± 5 vs. 15 ± 6 mmHg, p = 0.02]. Pulmonary vascular 
resistance did not differ between the groups. In multiple regression analysis, 
statin use was associated with a 4.2 mmHg (95% CI: 2 to 6.4, p = <0.001) lower 
PAWP and a 2.6 mmHg (95% CI: 0.3 to 4.9, p = 0.03) reduction in mPAP independent 
of PAWP.
CONCLUSIONS: In patients with severe COPD, statin use is associated with 
significantly lower PAWP and mPAP. These finding should be evaluated 
prospectively.

Chronic pulmonary conditions now account for 1 in 15 deaths in the US and 
mortality is increasing. Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is due to 
become the 3rd largest cause of mortality by 2030 and mortality from other 
respiratory conditions such as asthma, idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis and cystic 
fibrosis are not reducing. There is an urgent need for novel therapies to 
address this problem as many of the current strategies targeting inflammation 
are not sufficient. The innate immune system of the lung is an important defence 
against invading pathogens, but in many chronic pulmonary diseases, this system 
mounts an inappropriate response. In COPD, macrophages are increased in number, 
but fail to clear pathogens correctly and become highly activated. This leads to 
increased damage and remodelling of the airways. In idiopathic fibrosis, there 
is a switch of macrophage phenotype to a cell that promotes abnormal repair. 
Neutrophils also display dysfunction in COPD where aberrant migratory profiles 
may lead to increased damage to lung tissue and emphysema; while in cystic 
fibrosis the proteolytic lung environment damages neutrophil receptors leading 
to ineffective phagocytosis and migration. Targeting the innate immune system to 
restore 'normal function' could have enormous benefits. Improving phagocytosis 
of pathogens could reduce exacerbations and hence the associated decline in lung 
function, and novel therapeutics such as sulforaphane appear to do this in 
vitro. Other natural products such as resveratrol and derivatives also have 
anti-inflammatory properties. Statins have traditionally been used to manage 
cholesterol levels in hypercholesterolaemia, however these molecules also have 
beneficial effects on the innate immune cells. Statins have been shown to be 
anti-inflammatory and restore aberrant neutrophil chemotaxis in aged cells. 
Other possible agents that may be efficacious are senolytics. These compounds 
include natural products such as quercetin which have anti-inflammatory 
properties but can also suppress viral replication. As viruses have been shown 
to suppress phagocytosis of macrophages, it is possible that these compounds 
could have benefit during viral exacerbations to protect this innate response. 
These compounds demonstrate that it is possible to address defective innate 
responses in the lung but a better understanding of the mechanisms driving 
defective innate immunity in pulmonary disease may lead to improved 
therapeutics.

Introduction: Asthma-chronic obstructive pulmonary disease overlap syndrome 
(ACOS) is a disease phenotype that shares T helper lymphocyte cell 
Th1/neutrophilic/non-Type-2 Inflammation pathways thought to be key in COPD and 
Th2/eosinophilic/Type-2 inflammatory pathways of asthma. The pharmacology of 
treating ACOS is challenging in severe circumstances.Areas covered: This review 
evaluates the stepwise treatment of ACOS using pharmacological treatments used 
in both COPD and asthma. The most common medications involve the same inhalers 
used to treat COPD and asthma patients. Advanced stepwise therapies for ACOS 
patients are based on patient characteristics and biomarkers. Very few clinical 
trials exist that focus specifically on ACOS patients.Expert opinion: After 
inhalers, advanced therapies including phosphodiesterase inhibitors, macrolides, 
N-acetylcysteine and statin therapy for those ACOS patients with a COPD 
appearance and exacerbations are available. In atopic ACOS patients with 
exacerbations, advanced asthma therapies (leukotriene receptor antagonists and 
synthesis blocking agents.) are used. ACOS patients with elevated blood 
eosinophil/IgE levels are considered for immunotherapy or therapeutic monoclonal 
antibodies blocking specific Th2/Type-2 interleukins or IgE. Symptom control, 
stabilization/improvement in pulmonary function and reduced exacerbations are 
the metrics of success. More pharmacological trials of ACOS patients are needed 
to better understand which patients benefit from specific 
treatments.Abbreviations: 5-LOi: 5-lipoxygenase inhibitor; ACOS: asthma - COPD

Patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) have an increased 
risk of ischaemic heart disease (IHD). Statins reduce mortality and morbidity in 
IHD. It has been hypothesised that statin treatment is associated with reduced 
long-term mortality in patients with COPD. Using a retrospective cohort design, 
854 consecutive patients (mean age 70.8 yrs; 51.5% female) with a diagnosis of 
COPD exacerbation were included in the study at discharge from a Norwegian 
teaching hospital. Median follow-up was 1.9 yrs, during which 333 patients died. 
The crude mortality rate per 1,000 person-yrs was 110 in patients treated with 
statins, and 191 in patients not treated with statins. After adjustment for sex, 
age, smoking, pulmonary function and comorbidities, the hazard ratio (HR) for 
statin users versus statin nonusers was 0.57 (95% confidence interval 
0.38-0.87). When subdividing statin users and statin nonusers into groups 
according to concomitant treatment with inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) the 
following HRs were found: 0.75 (0.58-0.98) for ICS only; 0.69 (0.36-1.3) for 
statins only; and 0.39 (0.22-0.67) for the combined treatment with statin and 
ICS compared with no such treatment. Treatment with statins was associated with 
improved survival after chronic obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbation, 
while inhaled corticosteroids appeared to increase the survival benefit 
associated with statin use.

OBJECTIVES: Rising evidences showed a possible protective role of statins in 
chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). We aimed to evaluate in a post-hoc 
analysis of the GISSI-HF trial the prognostic effect of the use of rosuvastatin 
in patients with co-existing COPD and HF, assuming that the anti-inflammatory 
properties of these drugs may imply a potential beneficial effect in these 
associated chronic inflammatory conditions.
METHODS: We analyzed patients with chronic HF and history of COPD deriving from 
the GISSI-HF study. Of all 4574 patients eligible to statin, 1060 ambulatory 
patients with HF and concomitant COPD were enrolled and randomly assigned to 
rosuvastatin 10 mg daily (538 patients) or placebo (522 patients). The primary 
end-point was to compare all cause death rate in patients randomized to 
rosuvastatin or placebo. Further, we assessed the effects of rosuvastatin (10 mg 
daily) on cardiovascular (CV) death, non-CV death and hospital admissions. 
Median follow-up was 3.9 years with an interquartile range (IQR) of 3.0-4.4.
RESULTS: During the follow-up 438 (41.3%) patients died, 304 (28.6%) for CV 
death and 687 (64.8%) had at least one hospitalization. The two patient groups 
had similar outcome, irrespective of randomization, in terms of all-cause 
mortality (log-rank test p = 0.30) CV, non CV-death (p = 0.88 and 0.09 
respectively) and all-cause hospitalization (p = 0.82). Cox regression analysis 
did not show a favorable association between the use of statin and the examined 
end-points both on unadjusted and adjusted models.
CONCLUSIONS: Statin use is not associated with a beneficial effects on all 
cause, CV, non CV mortality and hospitalization in patients with coexistent 
chronic HF and history of COPD. ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT00336336.

disease: a nationwide population-based cohort study in Taiwan.

Hospital, Taipei, Taiwan, ROC.

BACKGROUND: Statins have been widely prescribed to treat hyperlipidemia, and can 
be used for primary and secondary prevention of cardiovascular diseases. Several 
studies have shown that statins have antiinflammatory effects in addition to 
cholesterol-lowering properties. There is new evidence suggesting that statins 
have beneficial effects on patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease 
(COPD), which is characterized by a persistent inflammatory response.
OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to determine the association between 
statins and COPD by using the Taiwan National Health Insurance database.
METHODS: This was a nationwide population-based cohort study. A total of 6252 
newly diagnosed COPD patients (median age, 64 years; 50.3% male) who received 
statins for hyperlipidemia treatment were identified from the 1 million sampling 
cohort dataset between January 2000 and December 2007. Another 12,469 newly 
diagnosed COPD patients (median age, 64 years; 50.3% male) who were matched for 
age, gender, and medication for COPD treatment, except for statin use, were 
enrolled as the control group. The end point of the study was hospitalization 
due to COPD.
RESULTS: During an average of 4.58 (2.36) years' follow-up period, there were 
1832 patients who experienced hospitalization for COPD exacerbation (statin vs 
control = 508 [8.1%] vs 1324 [10.6%]; P = 0.001). Statin use was independently 
associated with the decreased risk of COPD hospitalization (hazard ratio, 0.66; 
95% CI, 0.60-0.74; P < 0.001).
CONCLUSIONS: In the selected Taiwanese population, statins were associated with 
reduced hospitalization due to COPD in patients newly diagnosed with COPD, 
suggesting a potential beneficial effect of statins in patients with COPD.

OBJECTIVE: Most would agree that at least 1-year survival is necessary after 
intact abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) repair to appropriately justify the cost 
and risk of the procedure. No validated clinical decision instruments exist to 
predict survival after endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR) beyond the 
perioperative period. The purpose of this analysis was to create a preoperative 
prediction model for 1-year mortality after EVAR for intact AAA in the Society 
for Vascular Surgery Vascular Quality Initiative.
METHODS: All intact EVARs in the Society for Vascular Surgery Vascular Quality 
Initiative from 2011 to 2015 were randomly divided into training (n = 17,836) 
and validation (n = 2500) data sets, and 31 preoperative candidate predictors 
were identified. A logistic regression model for 1-year mortality was created, 
and bootstrapped stepwise variable elimination was used to reduce this model to 
a best subset of predictors. Penalized maximum likelihood estimation was used to 
correct for potential overfitting. The final model was internally validated by 
bootstrapping the area under the curve (AUC) and the calibration slope and 
intercept, and its performance when applied to the training and validation data 
sets was compared.
RESULTS: After elective and nonelective (symptomatic, intact) EVAR, 1-year 
mortality was 5.5% (n = 900/16,411) and 11.4% (n = 162/1425), respectively. The 
mean probability of 1-year mortality was 6.0% (n = 1062) in the training set and 
5.7% (n = 143) in the validation cohort (P = .12). Significant preoperative 
predictors of 1-year mortality included chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, 
age, preoperative renal insufficiency (creatinine concentration ≥1.8 mg/dL or on 
hemodialysis), ejection fraction <50%, transfer status, body mass 
index <24 kg/m2, preoperative beta-blocker exposure, larger AAA diameter, and 
lower admission hemoglobin level. Preoperative statin use was found to be 
protective. The bias-corrected AUC was 0.759 (Hosmer-Lemeshow goodness-of-fit P 
value of 0.36; calibration intercept, -0.003; slope, 0.999). When applied to the 
validation data set, the model had AUC of 0.724 (95% confidence interval, 
0.676-0.768; calibration intercept, 0.0009; slope, 0.970), which was in 
excellent agreement with the original data set bias-corrected AUC. Notably, 
∼27.5% (n = 4902) had four or more risk factors with a predicted 1-year 
post-EVAR mortality risk of 10% to 22% despite that 33.2% of these patients had 
AAA diameters below recommended treatment guideline minimum thresholds.
CONCLUSIONS: This validated preoperative prediction model for 1-year mortality 
identifies patients less likely to benefit from EVAR. Appropriateness of intact 
AAA EVAR care delivery can be improved by use of this clinical decision aid to 
determine which high-risk patients have lower probability of mortality within 
the first postoperative year relative to their predicted annualized rupture 
risk.

A cardiologist and respirologist examined the recent, neutral Prospective 
Randomized Placebo-Controlled Trial of Simvastatin in the Prevention of COPD 
Exacerbations (STATCOPE) for issues of relevance to cardiovascular risk 
reduction with statin medications. Although the potential benefit of the 
pleiotropic effects of statins on this inflammatory disease was not borne out, 
the effect over the longer term on total respiratory and cardiovascular 
morbidity and mortality remain unexplored. This study was unique as the only 
statin trial to date to use a national guideline (Adult Treatment Panel III) to 
exclude patients from the trial if at sufficient cardiovascular risk to warrant 
statin therapy. Furthermore, observed fatal and nonfatal cardiovascular events 
were shown to provide some evidence to suggest that statins might reduce 
cardiovascular events despite the low risk category and the relatively low 
levels of cholesterol. The magnitude of this beneficial trend paralleled the 
magnitude of lowering of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol achieved in the 
active statin arm. Finally, the authors questioned whether the current standard 
of care adequately includes adherence to any national lipid guideline or 
adequate attention to the cardiovascular comorbidity of these patients. In 
conclusion, knowledge translation of the STATCOPE trial should at a minimum 
encourage assessment of cardiovascular risk in patients with chronic obstructive 
pulmonary disease, implementation of proven cardiovascular risk reduction 
therapies based on national guidelines, including statins, and plans to 
undertake a trial adequate in size and duration to address cardiovascular event 
reduction in patients not already eligible for evidence-based risk-reducing 
therapies.

OBJECTIVES: Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is an inflammatory 
disease, in which chronic and systemic inflammation plays an important role. By 
decreasing neutrophil infiltration and cytokine production, statins have 
anti-inflammatory mechanisms.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Fifty-seven patients who had diagnosis of chronic 
obstructive pulmonary disease according to GOLD guideline were included in the 
study; 20 of them were statin users. Statin users group were patients being 
under medication with regular simvastatin, atorvastatin or rosuvastatin 20 mg 
per day for at least the past 1 year.
RESULTS: There was statistically no significant difference between patients with 
or without statin treatment with respect to; age, female-male ratio, COPD 
severity level, medication used for COPD, pulmonary function tests results and 
smoking habits. COPD exacerbation frequency in patients using statins was 
significantly less than patients not using statins (p<0.05). Patient number with 
COPD exacerbation, antibiotic treatment and outpatient clinic administration and 
outpatient clinic administration frequency was significantly lower in statin 
using patients (p<0.05).
CONCLUSION: COPD patients receiving statins have a lower frequency of COPD 
exacarbations, hospital administration and antibiotic treatment compared to 
patients not receiving statins.

BACKGROUND: Physical activity is an important clinical marker of disease status 
in COPD. COPD is also characterized by low-grade systemic inflammation. However, 
the relationship between physical activity and systemic inflammation in COPD is 
unclear.
METHODS: We monitored daily step count, a directly measured physical activity, 
using the StepWatch Activity Monitor, an ankle-worn accelerometer, in 171 people 
with stable COPD. Exercise capacity was assessed with the 6-min walk test 
(6MWT). We measured plasma C-reactive protein (CRP) and IL-6 levels. Linear 
regression models examined the cross-sectional associations of daily step count 
and 6MWT distance with CRP and IL-6 levels.
RESULTS: Subjects had a mean age 72±8 years and mean FEV1 1.5±0.57 L (54±20% 
predicted). Median daily step count was 5,203 (interquartile range [IQR], 
3,627-7,024], CRP level was 2.4 mg/L (IQR, 1.2-5.0), and IL-6 level was 2.9 
pg/mL (IQR, 2.0-5.1). Each 1,000-step increase in daily step count was 
associated with a 0.94 mg/L and 0.96 pg/mL decrease in CRP (P=.020) and IL-6 
(P=.044) levels, respectively, adjusting for age, FEV1 % predicted, pack-years 
smoked, cardiac disease, current statin use, history of acute exacerbations, and 
season. There was a significant linear trend of increasing daily step count by 
quartiles and decreasing CRP (P=.0007) and IL-6 (P=.023) levels. Higher 6MWT 
distance was also significantly associated with lower CRP and IL-6 values.
CONCLUSION: People with COPD who walked the most had the lowest plasma CRP and 
IL-6 levels. These results provide the conceptual basis to study whether an 
intervention to promote walking will reduce systemic inflammation in people with 
COPD.

BACKGROUND: Studies suggest that statins decrease mortality in COPD patients but 
it is unknown which patients might benefit most.
OBJECTIVES: We investigated whether statins were associated with reduced 
mortality in COPD patients and whether effects differed according to baseline 
high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP) concentration, a marker of systemic 
inflammation.
METHODS: This nested case-control study was part of the Rotterdam Study, a 
prospective population-based cohort study among 7983 subjects ≥ 55 years. Using 
automated pharmacy records, we evaluated statin use of 363 cases (COPD patients 
who died during follow-up of 17 years) with 2345 age and sex matched controls 
(COPD patients who survived the follow-up period of the index case).
RESULTS: Compared to never use, long-term statin use (>2 years) was associated 
with a 39% decreased risk of death in COPD patients. Stratified according to the 
level of systemic inflammation, long-term statin use was associated with a 78% 
reduced mortality if hsCRP level > 3 mg/L, versus a non significant 21% reduced 
mortality if hsCRP level ≤ 3 mg/L.
CONCLUSIONS: Statin use is associated with a beneficial effect on all-cause 
mortality in COPD, depending on the baseline level of systemic inflammation.

The objective of this study was to investigate whether statin 
(3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase inhibitor) use is associated 
with risk of Parkinson's disease (PD) in Denmark. We identified 1,931 patients 
with a first time diagnosis of PD reported in hospital or outpatient clinic 
records between 2001 and 2006. We density matched to these patients 9,651 
population controls by birth year and sex relying on the Danish population 
register. For every participant, we identified pharmacy records of statin and 
anti-Parkinson drug prescriptions since 1995 and before index date from a 
prescription medication use database for all Danish residents. Whenever 
applicable, the index dates for cases and their corresponding controls were 
advanced to the date of first recorded prescription for anti-Parkinson drugs. In 
our primary analyses, we excluded all statin prescriptions 2-years before PD 
diagnosis. Employing logistic regression adjusting for age, sex, diagnosis of 
chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and Charlson comorbidity, we observed 
none to slightly inverse associations between PD diagnosis and statin 
prescription drug use. Inverse associations with statin use were only observed 
for short-term (<or=1 yrs) statin users (2-year lag OR 0.57; 95% CI 0.36 to 
0.89); and suggested at higher intensity statin use (2-year lag OR 0.69; 95% CI 
0.45-1.04). No associations were seen among long-term users and no difference by 
sex, age, or type of statins used (lipophilic/hydrophilic). We found little 
evidence for a neuroprotective role of statins in PD except for short-term or 
high intensity users. Yet, further investigations into the contributions of 
intensity, duration, and lag periods of statin use may still be warranted.

BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Statin treatment may ameliorate viral infection-induced 
exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), which exhibit 
Th2-type bronchial inflammation. Thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP), a hub 
cytokine switching on Th2 inflammation, is overproduced in viral and 
dsRNA-stimulated bronchial epithelial cells from COPD donors. Hence, TSLP may be 
causally involved in exacerbations. This study tests the hypothesis that 
simvastatin inhibits dsRNA-induced TSLP.
EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH: Epithelial cells, obtained by bronchoscopy from COPD (n = 
7) and smoker control (n = 8) donors, were grown and stimulated with a viral 
infection and danger signal surrogate, dsRNA (10 μg·mL(-1) ). Cells were treated 
with simvastatin (0.2-5 μg·mL(-1) ), with or without mevalonate (13-26 μg·mL(-1) 
), or dexamethasone (1 μg·mL(-1) ) before dsRNA. Cytokine expression and 
production, and transcription factor (IRF3 and NF-κB) activation were 
determined.
KEY RESULTS: dsRNA induced TSLP, TNF-α, CXCL8 and IFN-β. TSLP was overproduced 
in dsRNA-exposed COPD cells compared with control. Simvastatin, but not 
dexamethasone, concentration-dependently inhibited dsRNA-induced TSLP. 
Unexpectedly, simvastatin acted independently of mevalonate and did not affect 
dsRNA-induced NF-κB activation nor did it reduce production of TNF-α and CXCL8. 
Instead, simvastatin inhibited dsRNA-induced IRF3 phosphorylation and generation 
of IFN-β.
CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS: Independent of mevalonate and NF-κB, previously 
acknowledged anti-inflammatory mechanisms of pleiotropic statins, simvastatin 
selectively inhibited dsRNA-induced IRF3 activation and production of TSLP and 
IFN-β in COPD epithelium. These data provide novel insight into epithelial 
generation of TSLP and suggest paths to be exploited in drug discovery aimed at 
inhibiting TSLP-induced pulmonary immunopathology.

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a progressive disease underlain 
by airway inflammation. Despite trials with new generations of anti-inflammatory 
drugs to alleviate the disease burden, the effective curative treatment remains 
elusive. In this context, the aim of this study was to assess the influence of 
simvastatin, a leading member of the family of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl 
coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitors, known to display anti-inflammatory 
and immunomodulatory activity, on symptoms and lung function, as well as the 
proportion of inflammatory cells, cytokines, proteolytic enzymes, and surfactant 
protein D (SP-D) content in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) in COPD 
patients. There were 50 patients with moderate-to-severe airway obstructions 
included into the study, subdivided into simvastatin-treated (Zocor - MSD; 40 mg 
daily) and control simvastatin-untreated groups, other treatment being equal. 
Pulmonary functions tests and bronchofiberoscopy with BALF procedure were 
performed before and after 3-month-long treatment in both groups. The major 
finding was that simvastatin treatment caused a distinct increase in the airway 
content of SP-D. Further effects, albeit smaller in magnitude, consisted of 
reductions in the proportion of airway neutrophils and in MMP-9 content, all 
with a benefit of improved score in the disease activity assessment test. There 
were no appreciable changes noted in lung function or dyspnea perception, which 
could be ascribed to simvastatin treatment. We conclude that statin's 
anti-inflammatory and surfactant homeostasis preserving properties may offer 
promise as an adjunctive treatment in COPD patients. The SP-D content in BALF 
has a potential to become a marker of COPD inflammatory activity and treatment 
monitoring.

BACKGOUND AND AIMS: We aimed at determining the effects of statin use on 
coronary artery disease (CAD) and stroke risks in patients with asthma-chronic 
obstructive pulmonary disease overlap syndrome (ACOS).
METHODS: We retrospectively enrolled patients with ACOS treated with (N = 916) 
and without (N = 6338) statins. The cumulative incidence of CAD and stroke 
(ischemic and hemorrhagic) was analyzed through time-dependent Cox proportional 
regression. After adjustment for sex, age, comorbidities, inhaled corticosteroid 
steroid (ICS) use, and oral steroid (OS) use, we calculated the adjusted hazard 
ratios (aHRs) and their 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for CAD or stroke in the 
statin users (long-term [>600 days] and short-term [≤600 days]) compared with 
the non-users.
RESULTS: Among the statin users, aHRs (95% CIs) for CAD and stroke were 0.50 
(0.41-0.62) and 0.83 (0.63-1.09), respectively; moreover, aHRs were 0.30 
(0.09-0.99) and 0.90 (0.68-1.20) for ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke, 
respectively. aHRs (95% CIs) for CAD and stroke were 0.58 (0.47-0.71) and 0.93 
(0.70-1.23), respectively, in the short-term users and 0.23 (0.13-0.41) and 0.42 
(0.19-0.89), respectively, in the long-term users.
CONCLUSIONS: CAD risk was lower in all statin users, regardless of the duration 
of use, whereas ischemic stroke risk was lower only in the long-term statin 
users. No association was observed between hemorrhagic stroke risk and statin 
use.

INTRODUCTION: Statins have diverse anti-inflammatory effects in addition to 
their lipid-lowering ability. This study assesses the rate of chronic 
obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) exacerbation and intubations in patients 
taking statins.
METHODS: This is a retrospective cohort study of 185 patients with COPD 
exacerbation, with a 1-year follow-up. Outcomes examined were repeat 
hospitalisation and intubations for COPD exacerbation. Baseline characteristics 
for which the p-value was < or = 0.10 were considered as covariates for 
inclusion in a multivariate model.
RESULTS: The statin group had fewer episodes of exacerbation and required 
intubation fewer times than the subjects not receiving statins (p < 0.0001 for 
both outcomes). Unadjusted odds ratios (OR) for no statin use vs. statin use 
were 9.54 (95% CI: 4.54-20.02) for exacerbation and 10.47 (CI: 4.56-24.01) for 
intubation. The OR, adjusted for the use of angiotensin-converting enzyme 
inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers (ORa), were 2.35 (CI: 1.01-5.50) for 
non-statin users exhibiting an exacerbation and 10.36 (CI: 2.77-38.76) for this 
group requiring intubation, compared with statin users. Similarly, ORa for 
long-acting beta(2) agonists as a covariate were 3.01 (CI: 1.46-6.10) for 
exacerbation and 8.89 (CI: 3.67-21.32) for intubation. Time to outcome during 
the observation period was reduced by statins with the hazard ratio (HR) for 
exacerbation of 0.19 (CI: 0.06-0.14); HR for statins reducing intubation was 
0.14 (95% CI: 0.10-0.30).
CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that the use of statins may be associated with 
lower incidence of both exacerbations and intubations in patients with COPD.

The objective of this study is to assess whether statin use is associated with 
beneficial effects on COPD outcomes. We conducted a systematic review and 
meta-analysis of all available studies describing the association between statin 
use and COPD mortality, exacerbations and cardiovascular events. Medline, 
Embase, Web of Science, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials 
were searched, with no restrictions. The hazard ratio (HR) with 95% confidence 
interval (CI) was estimated. Fifteen studies with a total of 238,459 patients 
were included. Nine articles provided data on all-cause mortality (124,543 
participants), and they gave a HR of 0.62 (95% CI 0.52 to 0.73). Three studies 
provided data on cancer mortality (90,077 participants), HR 0.83 (0.65 to 1.08); 
four studies on COPD mortality (88,767 participants), HR 0.48 (0.23 to 0.99); 
and three studies on cardiovascular mortality (90,041 participants), HR 0.93 
(0.50 to 1.72). Six articles provided data on COPD exacerbation with or without 
hospitalization (129,796 participants), HR 0.64 (0.55 to 0.75). Additionally, 
the use of statins was associated with a significant reduction risk of 
myocardial infarction, but not for stroke. Our systematic review showed a clear 
benefit of statins in patients with COPD.

BACKGROUND: The 3-hydroxy 3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitors (ie, 
statins) are widely used for the treatment of patients with hypercholesterolemia 
and cardiovascular disease. Emerging evidence suggests a beneficial effect of 
statins on the morbidity and mortality of patients with COPD. The objective of 
this study was to perform a systematic review of the literature evaluating the 
effect of statin therapy on outcomes in patients with COPD.
METHODS: Medline, Excerpta Medica Database, PapersFirst, and the Cochrane 
collaboration and Cochrane Register of controlled trials were searched. 
Randomized controlled trials (RCTs), observational cohort studies, case-control 
studies, and population-based analyses were considered for inclusion.
RESULTS: Nine studies were identified for review (four retrospective cohorts, 
one nested case-control study of a retrospective cohort, one retrospective 
cohort and case series, two population-based analyses, and one RCT). All studies 
showed a benefit from statin therapy for various outcomes in COPD patients, 
including the number of COPD exacerbations (n = 3), the number of and time to 
COPD-related intubations (n = 1), pulmonary function (eg, FEV(1) and FVC) [n = 
1], exercise capacity (n = 1), mortality from COPD (n = 2), and all-cause 
mortality (n = 3). No studies describing a negative or neutral effect from 
statin therapy on outcomes in COPD patients were identified.
CONCLUSIONS: The current literature collectively suggests that statins may have 
a beneficial role in the treatment of COPD. However, the majority of published 
studies have inherent methodological limitations of retrospective studies and 
population-based analyses. There is a need for prospective interventional trials 
designed specifically to assess the impact of statins on clinically relevant 
outcomes in COPD.

BACKGROUND: A number of medications such as beta-blockers,ACE-inhibitors, 
angiotensin receptor blockers and aldosterone antagonists, improve survival in 
patients with heart failure (HF) and reduced ejection fraction. No therapy has 
been proved to be beneficial for patients with heart failure and preserved 
ejection fraction (PLVEF).
OBJECTIVES: The aim of the study was to assess the effect of statin therapy on 
all-cause mortality and cardiovascular rehospitalization rate in patients with 
HF and PLVEF during one-year follow-up.
METHODS: We evaluated 146 patients with HF and PLVEF (ejection fraction > or = 
45%). Patients were divided into the statin therapy group (n = 103, mean age 69 
+/- 11 y, 52 men) and the group without statins (n = 43, mean age 66 +/- 16 y, 
25 men).We analysed the effects of the statin treatment prescribed to patients 
at discharge. Patients were followed up for one year.
RESULTS: The age, gender, NYHA functional class, prevalence of co-morbidities 
(renal dysfunction, COPD, diabetes mellitus) did not differ between the groups 
(P = NS). Patients receiving statin therapy more frequently had an ischaemic 
aetiology of HF (79% vs. 39.5%; P < 0.001) and hypertension (76% vs. 58%; P < 
0.05). No differences in ejection fraction were observed neither by 
echocardiography (58% vs. 55%; P = NS) nor by basic laboratory data. Patients 
who received statins were often additionally treated with beta-blockers (91% vs. 
70%; P < 0.005), aspirin (77 vs. 44%; P < 0.01), thienopyridines (22% vs. 5%; P 
< 0.01) and less frequently with oral anticoagulants (5% vs. 23%; P < 0.005). In 
the group receiving statins a significantly lower mortality (4% vs. 21%; P < 
0.001) and rehospitalization rate (43% vs. 69%; P < 0.05) was documented. After 
adjustment for all univariate predictors of the occurrence of study primary 
end-points, statin therapy was shown to be associated with significant and 
independent reduction in all-cause mortality (HR = 0.24 [95%CI:0.07 - 0.90] P < 
0.05) and cardiovascular rehospitalization rate (HR = 0.55 [95%CI: 0.33 - 0.92] 
P< 0.05). After propensity matching statin therapy remained an independent 
factor reducing one-year mortality rate (HR = 0. 11 [95%CI: 0.01 - 0.99] P < 
0.05].
CONCLUSIONS: This study showed that statin therapy may have beneficial effects 
on mortality and rehospitalization rates among patients with HF and PLVEF. It 
also suggests a potential role for statins as a new therapeutic option in 
patients with HF and PLVEF, but these observations need to be confirmed in large 
randomized trials.

PURPOSE: Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is associated with 
increased lung cancer risk. We evaluated the association of statin use with lung 
cancer risk in COPD patients and identified which statins possess the highest 
chemopreventive potential.
RESULTS: After adjustment for age, sex, CCI, diabetes, hypertension, 
dyslipidemia, urbanization level, and monthly income according to propensity 
scores, lung cancer risk in the statin users was lower than that in the statin 
nonusers (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR] = 0.37). Of the individual statins, 
lovastatin and fluvastatin did not reduce lung cancer risk significantly. By 
contrast, lung cancer risk in patients using rosuvastatin, simvastatin, 
atorvastatin, and pravastatin was significantly lower than that in statin 
nonusers (aHRs = 0.41, 0.44, 0.52, and 0.58, respectively). Statins 
dose-dependently reduced lung cancer risk in all subgroups and the main model 
with additional covariates (nonstatin drug use).
MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study cohort comprised all patients diagnosed with 
COPD at health care facilities in Taiwan (n = 116,017) between January 1, 2001 
and December 31, 2012. Our final study cohort comprised 43,802 COPD patients: 
10,086 used statins, whereas 33,716 did not. Patients were followed up to assess 
lung cancer risk or protective factors. In addition, we also considered 
demographic characteristics, namely age, sex, comorbidities (diabetes, 
hypertension, dyslipidemia, and Charlson comorbidity index [CCI]), urbanization 
level, monthly income, and nonstatin drug use. The index date of statin use was 
the COPD confirmation date. To examine the dose-response relationship, we 
categorized statin use into four groups in each cohort: < 28, 28-90, 91-365, and 
> 365 cumulative defined daily doses (cDDDs). Patients receiving < 28 cDDDs were 
defined as nonstatin users.
CONCLUSIONS: Statins dose-dependently exert a significant chemopreventive effect 
against lung cancer in COPD patients. Rosuvastatin, simvastatin, and 
atorvastatin exhibited the highest chemopreventive potential.

PURPOSE: We evaluated the chemopreventive effect of statins on colon cancer in 
patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and identified the 
statin exerting the strongest chemopreventive effect.
METHODS: Using the National Health Insurance Research Database, we identified 
patients who received a COPD diagnosis in Taiwan between January 1, 2001, and 
December 31, 2012, and included them in the study cohort. Each patient was 
followed to assess the colon cancer risk and protective factors. A propensity 
score was derived using a logistic regression model to estimate the effect of 
statins by accounting for covariates predicted during the intervention 
(statins). To examine the dose-response relationship, we categorized statin 
doses into four groups in each cohort [<28, 28-90, 91-365, and >365 cumulative 
defined daily dose].
RESULTS: Compared with the statin nonusers, the adjusted hazard ratio (aHR) for 
colon cancer decreased in the statin users (aHR = 0.52, 95% confidence interval 
= 0.44, 0.62). Hydrophilic statins exerted a stronger preventive effect against 
colon cancer. Regarding the statin type, lovastatin, pravastatin, and 
fluvastatin nonsignificantly reduced the colon cancer risk in the patients with 
COPD. Compared with the statin nonusers, the aHRs for colon cancer decreased in 
the individual statin users (rosuvastatin, simvastatin, and atorvastatin: aHRs = 
0.28, 0.64, and 0.65, respectively). In the sensitivity analysis, statins 
dose-dependently reduced the colon cancer risk.
CONCLUSIONS: Statins dose-dependently exert significant chemopreventive effects 
on colon cancer in patients with COPD, with rosuvastatin exerting the largest 
chemopreventive effect.

BACKGROUND: Statins have been long known for their lipid-lowering properties 
however there has been recent interest in their potential to positively 
influence clinical outcomes in pulmonary disease processes manifesting primarily 
as airway disorders.
OBJECTIVES: We review the potential use of statin therapy in respiratory 
medicine, with particular emphasis on airway disease. We also explore the 
possible mechanisms for the observed benefits of statins in conditions of the 
airway.
METHOD: A literary review of published articles related to defining the 
potential scientific basis for touted clinical efficacy, pertinent clinical data 
and review articles of statin therapy in airway disease.
RESULTS: There was a vast quantity of publications available pertaining to the 
topic of interest.
CONCLUSION: Statins may have beneficial pleiotropic effects in addition to their 
actions as potent lipid-lowering agents particularly in patients with chronic 
obstructive pulmonary disease and post lung transplantation. Further human 
studies are required to substantiate their possible potential as many of the 
clinical trials performed to date have not demonstrated the translation of 
results of these promising scientific and observational studies into positive 
outcomes in well-designed, randomized, placebo-controlled human trials.

It has been well established that statins, 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A 
(HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitors, reduce mortality from cardiovascular diseases. 
Statins, a class of cholesterol-lowering drug, may also affect mortality from 
various diseases by their pleiotropic effects of anti-inflammatory and 
anti-oxidative activities. However, there are only few reports concerning the 
effects of statins on diseases other than cardiovascular diseases. We therefore 
designed a population-based analysis, using the data from marketing surveys on 
statin sales and government reports on mortalities. We compared the statin use 
as expressed by statin sales per capita in the aged (> or = 65-year-old) 
population with mortality from major causes of death among 47 prefectures in 
Japan. As expected, there were significant negative correlations between statin 
sales per capita and mortality from cardiovascular diseases (p < 0.05). In 
addition, we found that there was a correlation between statin sales and the 
decrease in mortality from chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) (p < 
0.0001), senility (p < 0.01), pneumonia (p < 0.05), accidents (p < 0.05), or all 
death causes (p < 0.05). However, statin sales were not associated with 
mortalities from renal failure, liver diseases, suicide, and malignant diseases. 
These results suggest a broad spectrum of beneficial effects of statins, 
including reduction of mortality rate of COPD as well as cardiovascular 
diseases. It will be worthy to confirm the protective effect of statins on COPD 
by prospective randomized clinical trials.

BACKGROUND: COPD is currently the fourth leading cause of death worldwide. 
Statins are lipid lowering agents with documented cardiovascular benefits. 
Observational studies have shown that statins may have a beneficial role in 
COPD. The impact of statins on blood gene expression from COPD patients is 
largely unknown.
OBJECTIVE: Identify blood gene signature associated with statin use in COPD 
patients, and the pathways underpinning this signature that could explain any 
potential benefits in COPD.
METHODS: Whole blood gene expression was measured on 168 statin users and 451 
non-users from the ECLIPSE study using the Affymetrix Human Gene 1.1 ST 
microarray chips. Factor Analysis for Robust Microarray Summarization (FARMS) 
was used to process the expression data. Differential gene expression analysis 
was undertaken using the Linear Models for Microarray data (Limma) package 
adjusting for propensity score and surrogate variables. Similarity of the 
expression signal with published gene expression profiles was performed in 
ProfileChaser.
RESULTS: 25 genes were differentially expressed between statin users and 
non-users at an FDR of 10%, including LDLR, CXCR2, SC4MOL, FAM108A1, IFI35, 
FRYL, ABCG1, MYLIP, and DHCR24. The 25 genes were significantly enriched in 
cholesterol homeostasis and metabolism pathways. The resulting gene signature 
showed correlation with Huntington's disease, Parkinson's disease and acute 
myeloid leukemia gene signatures.
CONCLUSION: The blood gene signature of statins' use in COPD patients was 
enriched in cholesterol homeostasis pathways. Further studies are needed to 
delineate the role of these pathways in lung biology.

BACKGROUND: Published data on antiinflammatory and immunomodulatory effects of 
statins suggest they may reduce mortality risks associated with an unchecked 
immune response to selected infections, including influenza and COPD. We 
assessed whether statin users had reduced mortality risks from these conditions.
METHODS: We conducted a matched cohort study (n = 76,232) and two separate 
case-control studies (397 influenza and 207 COPD deaths) to evaluate whether 
statin therapy is associated with increased or decreased mortality risk and 
survival time using health-care encounter data for members of health maintenance 
organizations. For the cohort study, baseline illness risks from all causes 
prior to initiation of statin therapy were used to statistically adjust for the 
occurrence of outcomes after initiation of treatment.
RESULTS: For moderate-dose (>/= 4 mg/d) statin users, this cohort study found 
statistically significant reduced odds ratios (ORs) of influenza/pneumonia death 
(OR, 0.60; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.44 to 0.81) and COPD death (OR, 0.17; 
95% CI, 0.07 to 0.42) and similarly reduced survival hazard ratios. Findings 
were confirmed with the case-control studies. Confounding factors not considered 
may explain some of the effects observed.
CONCLUSIONS: This study found a dramatically reduced risk of COPD death and a 
significantly reduced risks of influenza death among moderate-dose statin users.

OBJECTIVE: Endovascular interventions of the common (CFA) and deep (DFA) femoral 
arteries are becoming more common. However, there is very little published data 
for guidance. Our objective was to analyze practice patterns and outcomes from 
these interventions.
METHODS: The Vascular Quality Initiative (2010-2015) was queried for all 
endovascular interventions of the CFA and DFA. Cases that were emergent or for 
acute limb ischemia were excluded. Those with isolated CFA with or without DFA 
treatment were analyzed.
RESULTS: There were 1014 patients that had either an isolated CFA intervention 
(946) with or without a DFA intervention (68). Average age of this isolated 
cohort was 67.4 ± 10.8 years, and 59% were male. Indications were claudication 
(67%), rest pain (16.3%), and tissue loss (16.7%). Periprocedural complications 
were access site hematoma (5.2%), arterial dissection (2.9%), distal 
embolization (0.7%), access site stenosis/occlusion (0.5%), and arterial 
perforation (0.6%). Thirty-day mortality was 1.6%. Survival was 92.9% at 1 year 
and 87.2% at 3 years. Amputation-free survival, freedom from loss of patency or 
death, and reintervention-free survival were 93.5%, 83%, and 87.5% at 1 year, 
respectively, by Kaplan-Meier analysis. Multivariable predictors of mortality 
were tissue loss, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), end-stage renal 
disease, urgent case, and age, whereas aspirin use and non-Caucasian race were 
protective. Tissue loss, rest pain, COPD, end-stage renal disease, stent use, 
nonambulatory status, and female sex were predictive of major amputation whereas 
aspirin use, P2Y12 antagonist use, statin use, and initial technical success 
were protective. Tissue loss, case urgency and nonambulatory status predicted 
patency loss or death. Tissue loss, COPD, stent use, and history of prior bypass 
predicted reintervention.
CONCLUSIONS: Endovascular interventions of the CFA/DFA have a low rate of 
periprocedural morbidity and mortality. One-year patency is lower than 
historically observed for CFA endarterectomy. Stent use is associated with 
reinterventions and amputation. Longer-term analysis is needed to better assess 
durability.

Cardiovascular disease is a major co-morbidity in chronic obstructive pulmonary 
disease (COPD) patients and is a predictor of all-cause mortality. This paper 
reviews the study design and data analyses of observational studies of 
cardiovascular drug effects in patients with COPD and evaluates the potential 
for bias on the validity of their findings. Three recent observational studies 
of statin use in the setting of COPD show surprisingly high efficacy results 
which, by their magnitude, demand closer analysis. Such analysis reveals that 
immortal time and immeasurable time biases likely accounted for dramatic 
findings of reduced mortality with aggressive treatment for cardiovascular 
disease. After removing these sources of bias, the effects are mitigated or may 
disappear entirely. Investigation of methods and results in the statin studies 
reviewed in this article reveals significant bias that has skewed the results of 
these early studies. Correcting these methodological flaws with proper 
statistical analysis may attenuate or even eliminate these apparent benefits.

OBJECTIVES: The objective of this study was to examine whether statin therapy is 
associated with enhanced endothelium-dependent vascular function, improved 
pulmonary function and reduced systemic inflammation in patients with chronic 
obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).
DESIGN AND SETTING: This randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, parallel 
trial including patients with COPD was performed at two University hospitals in 
Norway.
SUBJECTS, INTERVENTION AND MEASUREMENTS: Patients with stable COPD (n = 99) were 
assigned randomly to receive rosuvastatin 10 mg (n = 49) or matching placebo (n 
= 50) once daily for 12 weeks. The primary outcome measure was change in 
endothelium-dependent vascular function measured using peripheral arterial 
tonometry and expressed as the reactive hyperaemia index. Secondary end-points 
were change in pulmonary function, as assessed by forced expiratory volume in 1 
s (FEV1) and FEV1/forced vital capacity (FVC), and change in the circulating 
levels of the inflammatory markers interleukin-6 (IL6) and high-sensitivity 
C-reactive protein (hsCRP).
RESULTS: In the overall study population, no significant between-group 
difference in change in endothelium-dependent vascular or pulmonary function was 
observed. Rosuvastatin therapy was associated with a reduction in hsCRP (-20% 
vs. 11%, P = 0.017) and an attenuation of the rise in IL6 concentration (8% vs. 
30%, P = 0.028) compared with placebo. In a prespecified subgroup analysis of 
patients with a supra-median circulating hsCRP concentration (>1.7 mg L(-1) ), 
rosuvastatin was associated with improved endothelium-dependent vascular 
function (13% vs. 2%, P = 0.026).
CONCLUSIONS: In stable COPD patients without the standard indications for statin 
therapy, rosuvastatin treatment is associated with a significant attenuation of 
systemic inflammation and improvement in endothelial-dependent vascular function 
in patients with evidence of systemic inflammation.

BACKGROUND: The purpose of our study was to examine the association of prior 
outpatient use of statins and angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors on 
mortality for subjects >or= 65 years of age hospitalized with acute COPD 
exacerbations.
METHODS: We conducted a retrospective national cohort study using Veterans 
Affairs administrative data including subjects >or=65 years of age hospitalized 
with a COPD exacerbation. Our primary analysis was a multilevel model with the 
dependent variable of 90-day mortality and hospital as a random effect, 
controlling for preexisting comorbid conditions, demographics, and other 
medications prescribed.
RESULTS: We identified 11,212 subjects with a mean age of 74.0 years, 98% were 
male, and 12.4% of subjects died within 90-days of hospital presentation. In 
this cohort, 20.3% of subjects were using statins, 32.0% were using ACE 
inhibitors or angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARB). After adjusting for 
potential confounders, current statin use (odds ratio 0.51, 95% confidence 
interval 0.40-0.64) and ACE inhibitor/ARB use (0.55, 0.46-0.66) were 
significantly associated with decreased 90-day mortality.
CONCLUSION: Use of statins and ACE inhibitors prior to admission is associated 
with decreased mortality in subjects hospitalized with a COPD exacerbation. 
Randomized controlled trials are needed to examine whether the use of these 
medications are protective for those patients with COPD exacerbations.

RATIONALE: Bone marrow derived progenitor cells participate in the repair of 
injured vessels. The lungs of individuals with emphysema have reduced alveolar 
capillary density and increased endothelial apoptosis. We hypothesized that 
circulating levels of endothelial and hematopoietic progenitor cells would be 
reduced in this group of patients.
OBJECTIVES: The goal of this study was to measure circulating levels of 
endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) and hematopoietic progenitor cells (HPCs) in 
subjects with COPD and to determine if progenitor levels correlated with disease 
severity and the presence of emphysema.
METHODS: Peripheral blood mononuclear cells were isolated from 61 patients with 
COPD and 32 control subjects. Levels of EPCs (CD45(dim) CD34+) and HPCs (CD45(+) 
CD34(+) VEGF-R2(+)) were quantified using multi-parameter flow cytometry. 
Progenitor cell function was assessed using cell culture assays. All subjects 
were evaluated with spirometry and CT scanning.
MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: HPC levels were reduced in subjects with COPD 
compared to controls, whereas circulating EPC levels were similar between the 
two groups. HPC levels correlated with severity of obstruction and were lowest 
in subjects with severe emphysema. These associations remained after correction 
for factors known to affect progenitor cell levels including age, smoking 
status, the use of statin medications and the presence of coronary artery 
disease. The ability of mononuclear cells to form endothelial cell colony 
forming units (EC-CFU) was also reduced in subjects with COPD.
CONCLUSIONS: HPC levels are reduced in subjects with COPD and correlate with 
emphysema phenotype and severity of obstruction. Reduction of HPCs may disrupt 
maintenance of the capillary endothelium, thereby contributing to the 
pathogenesis of COPD.

INTRODUCTION: Statins may have pleiotropic effects in COPD, but mechanisms 
remain unclear.
OBJECTIVES: To assess the pleiotropic effect of statins in patients with stable 
COPD on (1): lung function (2); pulmonary and systemic inflammation (3); 
endothelial function (vascular stiffness) and circulating vascular growth 
factors; and (4), serum uric acid levels.
METHOD: Pilot, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial in 24 
patients with stable COPD, all statin-naïve, who were randomized (1:1) to 
receive simvastatin 40 mg/24 h during 12 weeks (n = 12; 69.0 ± 7.3 years; 
post-bd FEV1 53.4 ± 10.0% pred.) or placebo (n = 12; 66.4 ± 4.6 years; post-bd 
FEV1 48.2 ± 12.6% pred.). Nine patients per group (total n = 18) completed the 
study.
RESULTS: Lung function, pulmonary and systemic inflammatory markers and the 
degree of vascular stiffness did not change significantly in any group. However, 
treatment with simvastatin increased the plasma levels of erythropoietin (Epo) 
(4.2 ± 2.2 mIU/mL to 6.8 ± 3.2 mlU/mL, p < 0.05) and reduced those of serum uric 
acid (7.1 ± 1.3 mg/dL to 6.5 ± 1.4 mg/dL, p < 0.01).
CONCLUSIONS: Short-term treatment with simvastatin in stable COPD patients did 
not modify lung function, pulmonary and systemic inflammation, or vascular 
stiffness, but it changed Epo and uric acid levels.

BACKGROUND: Previous animal studies and clinical trials report inconsistent 
findings regarding the role of statins in pulmonary hypertension (PH). 
Systematic reviews have shown no use of statins on pulmonary arterial 
hypertension (PAH). This is the first meta-analysis of randomized controlled 
trials (RCTs) determining the clinical impacts of statin therapy on patients 
with PH secondary to lung diseases.
METHODS: Electronic databases and manual bibliographical searches were 
conducted. Eligible studies included RCTs of at least 3 months that evaluated 
statin therapy as compared with control in adult patients with PH due to 
pulmonary diseases. Statistical analyses were performed to calculate mean 
difference, relative risks (RRs), and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) using 
random-effect model.
RESULTS: A total of 6 RCTs were identified and included in this study. Five 
trials reported the effects of statins in patients with both chronic obstructive 
pulmonary disease (COPD) and PH, and the remaining 1 was based on PH due to 
pneumoconiosis. We found that statin therapy was associated with increased 
6-minute walk distance and reduced pulmonary artery systolic pressure. There was 
no observed difference in the incidence of death, drug withdrawal, and adverse 
event between statin and control group.
CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that statins might be safe and beneficial for 
patients with PH due to chronic lung diseases. However, larger RCTs with more 
patients and longer observational duration are needed.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Clinical guidelines recommend the use of beta-blockers 
and other cardiovascular prevention drugs in patients with acute coronary 
syndrome (ACS). Studies in several countries have found that beta-blockers are 
underused in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and 
co-morbid heart disease, although most have only examined use in subgroups of 
patients. We undertook a nationwide follow-up study in New Zealand to describe 
the use of beta-blockers and other cardiovascular prevention drugs in patients 
with COPD and ACS.
METHODS: National health and pharmaceutical dispensing data were used to derive 
the study cohort, identify patients who were admitted to hospital with ACS 
and/or heart failure before cohort entry and during follow-up, and ascertain 
drug use.
RESULTS: The study cohort included 83 435 patients aged ≥45 years, with 290 400 
person-years of follow-up. Among 2637 patients with ≥1 ACS admission during 
follow-up, only 56.6% received a beta-blocker in the 6 months following the 
first admission, while 87.7% and 81%, respectively, received aspirin and a 
statin. Patients with higher COPD severity were less likely to receive a 
beta-blocker than those with lower severity, as were those with no history of 
previous ACS and/or heart failure.
CONCLUSION: Use of beta-blockers following an ACS admission was much lower than 
expected based on the findings of general audits of ACS management in New 
Zealand. Along with the higher proportions using aspirin and statins, and the 
differences in beta-blocker dispensing by COPD severity, this suggests a 
particular reluctance to prescribe beta-blockers to patients with COPD.

Inflammation is an increasingly recognized hallmark of pulmonary hypertension 
(PH). Statins have been shown to attenuate key pathologic mechanisms via 
pleiotropic effects in animal models. However, clinical benefit of statins in 
patients with PH is unknown and their effect on mortality has not been studied. 
We performed a retrospective analysis of patients between January 2002 to 
January 2012, with severe PH (pulmonary artery systolic pressure ≥60 mmHg) and 
preserved left ventricular function (ejection fraction ≥50%), defined by 
transthoracic echocardiograms. Patients were divided into two groups based on 
statin therapy for 12 consecutive months after diagnosis of PH. Propensity score 
matching was performed. Subgroup analysis was done based on COPD status. Study 
endpoint was 1-year all-cause mortality and hospitalization. 2363 patients (age 
71 ± 16; 31% male) were included; 140 (6%) were on statin therapy. Overall 
1-year mortality was 34%. Following propensity score matching, 138 patients were 
included in the statin group and 624 patients in the no-statin group; all-cause 
mortality was significantly lower in the statin group compared with the 
no-statin group [15.2 vs. 33.8%, HR 0.42 (95% CI 0.27, 0.66), p < 0.001], but 
hospitalization was comparable between two groups. After stratifying patients 
based on COPD status, patients with COPD showed a marginally significant 
survival benefit from statins [HR 0.53 (95% CI 0.26, 1.10), p = 0.09]; and 
statins significantly reduced 1-year all-cause mortality in patients without 
COPD [HR 0.36 (95% CI 0.19, 0.67), p = 0.001]. We found no significant 
difference in the effect of statins on patients with COPD compared to those 
without (p = 0.16). Statin therapy is associated with reduced mortality risk in 
patients with severe PH and preserved left ventricular function. This beneficial 
effect was not found to be dependent on COPD status. These novel findings should 
be confirmed in large randomized trials.

OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to describe the epidemiology, 
clinical features, outcomes, and predictors of mortality in veterans with 
peripheral artery disease (PAD).
METHODS: We used national data from the Veterans Health Administration from 
fiscal years 2009 to 2011 to identify patients with a new diagnosis of PAD. 
Within this cohort, we describe characteristics of the patients, use of 
recommended medications, and clinical outcomes during a 3-year follow-up (fiscal 
year 2014). We used Cox proportional hazards regression to examine predictors of 
mortality and adverse limb outcomes (amputation and hospitalization for critical 
limb ischemia [CLI]) during follow-up.
RESULTS: A total of 175,865 patients with a new diagnosis of PAD were included. 
The mean age was 69.9 years; 97.8% were male, and 67.7% were white. Nearly 77% 
of patients had hypertension, 46.5% had diabetes, 23% had chronic obstructive 
pulmonary disease, and 12.9% had renal failure. A prescription for statins was 
filled by 60.8%, and 34.9% received high-intensity statins within 90 days of PAD 
diagnosis. At 1 year, 2.6% underwent revascularization, 1.3% developed CLI, and 
1.1% underwent amputation. During a median follow-up of 3.8 years, a total of 
28.6% patients died (6.7% at 1 year), and 3.7% developed a limb outcome (2.0% at 
1 year). Predictors of mortality included advanced age, comorbidities, and CLI 
or amputation at presentation. In contrast, prescription with statins was 
associated with lower mortality. Similar findings were present with regard to 
predictors of adverse limb outcomes, except that older age was associated with a 
lower risk of amputation or CLI.
CONCLUSIONS: We found that veterans with PAD have a high prevalence of comorbid 
conditions and have a significant risk of mortality and limb loss. A substantial 
proportion of veterans with PAD are not prescribed recommended medications, 
especially statin therapy. Our data highlight important opportunities for 
improving care of veterans with PAD.

BACKGROUND: Postoperative atrial fibrillation is the most common arrhythmia seen 
after cardiac surgery. We aimed to determine the effect of obesity and metabolic 
syndrome on postoperative atrial fibrillation, whether they are independent risk 
factors, and their effect level. We also analyzed the effect of atrial 
fibrillation on postoperative complications.
METHODS: In our clinic, 756 patients who underwent coronary artery bypass 
grafting between June 2010-September 2017 were evaluated retrospectively. 
Preoperatively, demographic characteristics, chronic diseases, body mass index, 
waist circumference measurements, and ejection fraction values of the cases were 
determined from file records. Perioperatively, cross-clamp and cardiopulmonary 
bypass times, intra-aortic balloon use, distal coronary bypass counts were 
determined. Postoperatively, complications, duration of intensive care unit and 
hospital stay, and mortality were evaluated. The patients were followed up with 
continuous 3-lead ECG monitorization on the postoperative first day and 12-lead 
ECG records once in a day on the remaining days. In the study, the first 
endpoint was the determination of atrial fibrillation and the second endpoint 
was the discharge time of the patient.
RESULTS: The rate of postoperative atrial fibrillation was 21.3%. Atrial 
fibrillation was seen in 33% of metabolic syndrome cases and in 38.5% of obese 
cases. Atrial fibrillation was seen in 23, 24 and 17% of cases using statin, ACE 
inhibitor and beta blocker, respectively. It was seen in 21% of smokers and 20% 
of the COPD cases. In the study, metabolic syndrome, diabetes mellitus, 
hypertension, and obesity, between the ages of 56-78 with Metabolic syndrome, 
were found to affect the development of postoperative atrial fibrillation 
(2.46), (2.3), (1.6), and (1.65) times, respectively. In cases with 
postoperative atrial fibrillation, infection and stroke were 1.45 and 8.85 times 
more frequent, respectively. Patients with metabolic syndrome were found to have 
31% longer hospital stay, and 17% higher infection rate. In obese patients, 
hospitalization was 23.5% longer.
CONCLUSIONS: Metabolic syndrome and obesity were found to be two independent 
risk factors for postoperative atrial fibrillation. If causes and mechanisms of 
postoperative atrial fibrillation are identified in planned cardiovascular 
interventions, we believe that cost of hospitalization and morbidity will be 
reduced.

OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to investigate the relationship 
between adherence to statin therapy and the risk of exacerbation among elderly 
individuals affected by chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and cardiovascular 
disease.
METHODS: Using the healthcare utilisation databases of five Italian territorial 
units accounting for nearly 35% of the Italian population, we recruited a cohort 
of 6263 elderly persons (i.e. aged 65 years or older) with co-existing chronic 
obstructive pulmonary disease and cardiovascular disease who initiated statin 
therapy. Exposure was adherence to statins measured by the proportion of days of 
follow-up covered. Outcome was the first hospital admission for chronic 
obstructive pulmonary disease occurring in the period of observation. A 
proportional hazards model was used to estimate the hazard ratio and 95% 
confidence intervals for the exposure-outcome association, after adjusting for 
several covariates. A set of sensitivity analyses was performed to account for 
sources of systematic uncertainty.
RESULTS: During an average follow-up of about 4 years, 1307 cohort members 
experienced the outcome. Compared with patients with low adherence (proportion 
of days of follow-up covered ≤ 40%), those with intermediate (proportion of days 
of follow-up covered 41-80%) and high (proportion of days of follow-up 
covered > 80%) adherence exhibited a lower risk of exacerbation of 16% (95% 
confidence interval 3-27) and 23% (95% confidence interval 10-34).
CONCLUSIONS: In a real-world setting, we observed evidence that adherence to 
statin therapy markedly reduced the risk of chronic obstructive pulmonary 
disease exacerbations in elderly patients with co-existing chronic obstructive 
pulmonary disease and cardiovascular disease. Given the limited and 
controversial evidence from trials, more randomised controlled trials are 
urgently needed to better examine the potential benefits of statins as adjunct 
therapy in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
