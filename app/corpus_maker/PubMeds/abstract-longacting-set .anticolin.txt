We performed a meta-analysis to compare the impact of triple combination therapy 
with inhaled corticosteroids (ICS), long-acting β2-agonists (LABAs) and 
long-acting muscarinic receptor antagonists (LAMAs) versus LABA/LAMA combination 
therapy or single long-acting bronchodilator therapy in chronic obstructive 
pulmonary disease. The ICS/LABA/LAMA combination reduced the risk of 
exacerbation (relative risk 0.70, 95% CI 0.53-0.94) and improved trough forced 
expiratory volume in 1 s (mean difference in mL +37.94, 95% CI 18.83-53.89) 
versus LABA/LAMA combination therapy. The protective effect of triple 
combination therapy versus LABA/LAMA combination therapy against risk of 
exacerbation was greater in patients with blood eosinophil counts 
≥300 cells·µL-1 (relative risk 0.57, 95% CI 0.48-0.68). While ∼38 patients had 
to be treated for 1 year with ICS/LABA/LAMA combination therapy to prevent one 
exacerbation compared to LABA/LAMA combination therapy, the number needed to 
treat (NNT) was ∼21 when compared to single long-acting bronchodilator therapy. 
The person-based NNT per year of ICS/LABA/LAMA combination therapy versus 
LABA/LAMA combination therapy was significantly (p<0.05) lower in patients with 
eosinophil counts ≥300 cells·µL-1 (NNT value: 8.58) than in those with counts 
<300 cells·µL-1 (NNT value: 46.28). The risk of pneumonia did not differ between 
ICS/LABA/LAMA combination therapy and its comparators. The number needed to harm 
was ∼195. This meta-analysis suggests that patients on single long-acting 
bronchodilator therapy or LABA/LAMA combination therapy, who still have 
exacerbations and have blood eosinophil counts ≥300 cells·µL-1, could benefit 
from ICS/LABA/LAMA combination therapy.

Diagnosis and Outpatient Management of Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease: A 
Review.

Medicine, University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.

IMPORTANCE: There are 30 million adults (12%) in the United States who have 
chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Chronic obstructive pulmonary 
disease accounts for 3.2% of all physician office visits annually and is the 
fourth leading cause of death (126 000 deaths per year). Most patients are 
diagnosed by their primary care clinicians who must address the highly variable 
clinical features and responses to therapy. The diagnosis and treatment of COPD 
is rapidly changing, so understanding recent advances is important for the 
delivery of optimal patient care.
OBSERVATIONS: Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease is characterized by 
incompletely reversible expiratory airflow limitation. Spirometry is the 
reference standard for diagnosing and assessing the severity of COPD. All 
patients should be counseled about and receive preventive measures such as 
smoking cessation and vaccination. Treatment should be guided by the severity of 
lung impairment, symptoms such as dyspnea, the amount of cough and sputum 
production, and how often a patient experiences an exacerbation. When dyspnea 
limits activity or quality of life, COPD should be treated with once- or 
twice-daily maintenance long acting anticholinergic and β-agonist 
bronchodilators. Patients with acute exacerbations may benefit from the addition 
of inhaled corticosteroids, particularly those with elevated peripheral 
eosinophil levels. Pulmonary rehabilitation, which includes strength and 
endurance training and educational, nutritional, and psychosocial support, 
improves symptoms and exercise tolerance but is underutilized. Supplemental 
oxygen for patients with resting hypoxemia (defined as Spo2 <89%) improves 
survival.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease is a 
complicated disease requiring intensive treatment. Appropriate use of 
long-acting maintenance bronchodilators, inhaled corticosteroids, and pulmonary 
rehabilitation decreases symptoms, optimizes functional performance, and reduces 
exacerbation frequency. Supplemental oxygen in patients with resting hypoxemia 
prolongs life, and other advanced treatments are available based on specific 
patient characteristics.

BACKGROUND: Long-acting bronchodilators such as long-acting β-agonist (LABA), 
long-acting muscarinic antagonist (LAMA), and LABA/inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) 
combinations have been used in people with moderate to severe chronic 
obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) to control symptoms such as dyspnoea and 
cough, and prevent exacerbations. A number of LABA/LAMA combinations are now 
available for clinical use in COPD. However, it is not clear which group of 
above mentioned inhalers is most effective or if any specific formulation works 
better than the others within the same group or class.
OBJECTIVES: To compare the efficacy and safety of available formulations from 
four different groups of inhalers (i.e. LABA/LAMA combination, LABA/ICS 
combination, LAMA and LABA) in people with moderate to severe COPD. The review 
will update previous systematic reviews on dual combination inhalers and 
long-acting bronchodilators to answer the questions described above using the 
strength of a network meta-analysis (NMA).
SEARCH METHODS: We identified studies from the Cochrane Airways Specialised 
Register, which contains several databases. We also conducted a search of 
ClinicalTrials.gov and manufacturers' websites. The most recent searches were 
conducted on 6 April 2018.
SELECTION CRITERIA: We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that 
recruited people aged 35 years or older with a diagnosis of COPD and a baseline 
forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) of less than 80% of predicted. We 
included studies of at least 12 weeks' duration including at least two active 
comparators from one of the four inhaler groups.
DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: We conducted NMAs using a Bayesian Markov chain 
Monte Carlo method. We considered a study as high risk if recruited participants 
had at least one COPD exacerbation within the 12 months before study entry and 
as low risk otherwise. Primary outcomes were COPD exacerbations (moderate to 
severe and severe), and secondary outcomes included symptom and quality-of-life 
scores, safety outcomes, and lung function. We collected data only for active 
comparators and did not consider placebo was not considered. We assumed a 
class/group effect when a fixed-class model fitted well. Otherwise we used a 
random-class model to assess intraclass/group differences. We supplemented the 
NMAs with pairwise meta-analyses.
MAIN RESULTS: We included a total of 101,311 participants from 99 studies (26 
studies with 32,265 participants in the high-risk population and 73 studies with 
69,046 participants in the low-risk population) in our systematic review. The 
median duration of studies was 52 weeks in the high-risk population and 26 weeks 
in the low-risk population (range 12 to 156 for both populations). We considered 
the quality of included studies generally to be good.The NMAs suggested that the 
LABA/LAMA combination was the highest ranked treatment group to reduce COPD 
exacerbations followed by LAMA in the both populations.There is evidence that 
the LABA/LAMA combination decreases moderate to severe exacerbations compared to 
LABA/ICS combination, LAMA, and LABA in the high-risk population (network hazard 
ratios (HRs) 0.86 (95% credible interval (CrI) 0.76 to 0.99), 0.87 (95% CrI 0.78 
to 0.99), and 0.70 (95% CrI 0.61 to 0.8) respectively), and that LAMA decreases 
moderate to severe exacerbations compared to LABA in the high- and low-risk 
populations (network HR 0.80 (95% CrI 0.71 to 0.88) and 0.87 (95% CrI 0.78 to 
0.97), respectively). There is evidence that the LABA/LAMA combination reduces 
severe exacerbations compared to LABA/ICS combination and LABA in the high-risk 
population (network HR 0.78 (95% CrI 0.64 to 0.93) and 0.64 (95% CrI 0.51 to 
0.81), respectively).There was a general trend towards a greater improvement in 
symptom and quality-of-life scores with the combination therapies compared to 
monotherapies, and the combination therapies were generally ranked higher than 
monotherapies.The LABA/ICS combination was the lowest ranked in pneumonia 
serious adverse events (SAEs) in both populations. There is evidence that the 
LABA/ICS combination increases the odds of pneumonia compared to LAMA/LABA 
combination, LAMA and LABA (network ORs: 1.69 (95% CrI 1.20 to 2.44), 1.78 (95% 
CrI 1.33 to 2.39), and 1.50 (95% CrI 1.17 to 1.92) in the high-risk population 
and network or pairwise OR: 2.33 (95% CI 1.03 to 5.26), 2.02 (95% CrI 1.16 to 
3.72), and 1.93 (95% CrI 1.29 to 3.22) in the low-risk population respectively). 
There were significant overlaps in the rank statistics in the other safety 
outcomes including mortality, total, COPD, and cardiac SAEs, and dropouts due to 
adverse events.None of the differences in lung function met a minimal clinically 
important difference criterion except for LABA/LAMA combination versus LABA in 
the high-risk population (network mean difference 0.13 L (95% CrI 0.10 to 0.15). 
The results of pairwise meta-analyses generally agreed with those of the NMAs. 
There is no evidence to suggest intraclass/group differences except for lung 
function at 12 months in the high-risk population.
AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: The LABA/LAMA combination was the highest ranked treatment 
group to reduce COPD exacerbations although there was some uncertainty in the 
results. LAMA containing inhalers may have an advantage over those without a 
LAMA for preventing COPD exacerbations based on the rank statistics. Combination 
therapies appear more effective than monotherapies for improving symptom and 
quality-of-life scores. ICS-containing inhalers are associated with an increased 
risk of pneumonia.Our most comprehensive review including intraclass/group 
comparisons, free combination therapies, 99 studies, and 20 outcomes for each 
high- and low-risk population summarises the current literature and could help 
with updating existing COPD guidelines.

RATIONALE: The efficacy of intensified combination therapy with inhaled 
corticosteroids (ICS) and long-acting β2-agonists (LABA) at the onset of upper 
respiratory tract infection (URTI) symptoms in chronic obstructive pulmonary 
disease (COPD) is unknown.
OBJECTIVES: To evaluate whether intensified combination therapy with ICS/LABA, 
at the onset of URTI symptoms, decreases the incidence of COPD exacerbation 
occurring within 21 days of the URTI.
METHODS: A total of 450 patients with stable, moderate to very severe COPD, were 
included in this investigator-initiated and -driven, double-blind, randomized, 
placebo-controlled study. At inclusion, patients were assigned to open-labeled 
low-maintenance dose ICS/LABA. Each patient was randomized either to 
intensified-dose ICS/LABA or placebo and instructed to start using this 
medication only in case of a URTI, at the onset of symptoms, twice daily, for 10 
days.
MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: The incidence of any exacerbation following a 
URTI was not significantly decreased in the ICS/LABA group, as compared with 
placebo (14.6% vs. 16.2%; hazard ratio, 0.77; 95% confidence interval, 
0.46-1.33; P = 0.321) but the risk of severe exacerbation was decreased by 72% 
(hazard ratio, 0.28; 95% confidence interval, 0.11-0.74%; P = 0.010). In the 
stratified analysis, effect size was modified by disease severity, fractional 
exhaled nitric oxide, and the body mass index-airflow obstruction-dyspnea, and 
exercise score. Compared with the stable period, evidence of at least one virus 
was significantly more common at URTI, 10 days after URTI, and at exacerbation.
CONCLUSIONS: Intensified combination therapy with ICS/LABA for 10 days at URTI 
onset did not decrease the incidence of any COPD exacerbation but prevented 
severe exacerbation. Patients with more severe disease had a significant risk 
reduction for any exacerbation. Clinical trial registered with www.isrctn.com 
(ISRCTN45572998).

Recently, two "fixed triple" single-inhaler combinations of an inhaled 
corticosteroid (ICS), a long-acting β2-agonist (LABA), and a long-acting 
muscarinic antagonist (LAMA) have become available for patients with COPD. This 
review presents the clinical evidence that led to the approval of these triple 
therapies, discusses the role of ICS in patients with COPD, and presents data on 
the relative efficacy of "fixed triple" (ICS/LAMA/LABA) therapy vs LAMA, 
ICS/LABA, and LAMA/LABA combinations, and summarizes studies in which ICS/LABAs 
were combined with LAMAs to form "open triple" combinations. Of the five main 
fixed triple studies completed so far, three evaluated the efficacy and safety 
of an extrafine formulation of beclometasone dipropionate, formoterol fumarate, 
and glycopyrronium; the other two studies evaluated fluticasone furoate, 
vilanterol, and umeclidinium. Overall, compared to LAMA, ICS/LABA, or LAMA/LABA, 
triple therapy decreased the risk of exacerbations and improved lung function 
and health status, with a favorable benefit-to-harm ratio. Furthermore, triple 
therapy showed a promising signal in terms of improved survival. The evidence 
suggests that triple therapy is the most effective treatment in moderate/severe 
symptomatic patients with COPD at risk of exacerbations, with marginal if any 
risk of side effects including pneumonia. Ongoing studies are examining the role 
of triple therapy in less severe symptomatic patients with COPD and asthma-COPD 
overlap.

OBJECTIVE: To review the management of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease 
(COPD), with a focus on updated information regarding the use of long-acting 
bronchodilators in the prevention of exacerbations and outcomes associated with 
this disease.
DATA SOURCES: A literature search of the MEDLINE databases through November 2017 
was conducted. All published articles regarding use of bronchodilator therapy in 
the management of COPD were evaluated. References of selected articles, data 
from poster presentations, and abstract publications were additionally reviewed.
STUDY SELECTION AND DATA EXTRACTION: Available English-language data from 
reviews, abstracts, presentations, and clinical trials of the treatment of 
stable COPD with bronchodilator therapy in humans were reviewed; relevant 
clinical data were selected and included.
DATA SYNTHESIS: COPD is a prevalent medical condition worldwide that results in 
functional impairment, and worsened quality of life and overall health status. 
Numerous treatment options are available; the rationale for the optimal agents 
to utilize in a particular patient case is dependent on a multitude of 
patient-specific factors and severity of disease. In this review, a discussion 
of the role of long-acting bronchodilators, including long-acting β agonists and 
long-acting muscarinic antagonists will be explored. Additionally, an update on 
the roles of novel delivery devices for delivering respiratory medications in 
this medical condition will be described.
CONCLUSION: Although numerous treatment options are available, management of 
COPD remains a clinical challenge. Long-acting bronchodilators represent a 
significant class of medications that have the potential to reduce exacerbations 
and related hospitalizations and improve overall health outcomes.

Inhaled, long acting anticholinergic medication (LAA), commonly used for 
moderate-to-severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), has been shown 
to decrease COPD hospitalizations, emergency department visits, and acute 
exacerbations but has also been associated with urinary tract infection (UTI) in 
a prior meta-analysis. The objective of this study was to verify if there was an 
association between LAA and UTI in older individuals with COPD. A 
population-based, real-world cohort study using health administrative data from 
Ontario, Canada was conducted. Incidence of UTI was compared between older 
people with physician-diagnosed COPD, who were new users of inhaled long-acting 
anticholinergics and new users of inhaled corticosteroids-a reference medication 
used in similar clinical settings that has no known association with UTI. 
Propensity score matching was used to minimize the effects of confounding. An 
overall association between LAA and various measures of UTI in older individuals 
was not found. However, in a priori defined stratified analyses, men newly 
initiated on LAA were 75% more likely to develop a UTI than men newly started on 
an inhaled corticosteroid (hazard ratio 1.75; 95% confidence interval 
1.05-2.92). No significant association was seen in women. In conclusion, older 
men with COPD newly started on LAA are at increased risk of UTI. Men considering 
an inhaled LAA should be informed of this risk and, if they decide to take it, 
be provided with appropriate monitoring.

BACKGROUND: Randomized, controlled trials comparing long-acting muscarinic 
antagonist (LAMA) efficacy in COPD are limited. This network meta-analysis (NMA) 
assessed the relative efficacy of tiotropium 18 µg once-daily (OD) and newer 
agents (aclidinium 400 µg twice-daily, glycopyrronium 50 µg OD, and umeclidinium 
62.5 µg OD).
METHODS: A systematic literature review identified randomized, controlled trials 
of adult COPD patients receiving LAMAs. A NMA within a Bayesian framework 
examined change from baseline in trough forced expiratory volume in 1 second 
(FEV1), transitional dyspnea index focal score, St George's Respiratory 
Questionnaire score, and rescue medication use.
RESULTS: Twenty-four studies (n=21,311) compared LAMAs with placebo/each other. 
Aclidinium, glycopyrronium, tiotropium, and umeclidinium, respectively, 
demonstrated favorable results versus placebo, for change from baseline (95% 
credible interval) in 12-week trough FEV1 (primary endpoint: 101.40 mL 
[77.06-125.60]; 117.20 mL [104.50-129.90]; 114.10 mL [103.10-125.20]; 136.70 mL 
[104.20-169.20]); 24-week trough FEV1 (128.10 mL [84.10-172.00]; 135.80 mL 
[123.10-148.30]; 106.40 mL [95.45-117.30]; 115.00 mL [74.51-155.30]); 24-week St 
George's Respiratory Questionnaire score (-4.60 [-6.76 to -2.54]; -3.14 [-3.83 
to -2.45]; -2.43 [-2.92 to -1.93]; -4.69 [-7.05 to -2.31]); 24-week transitional 
dyspnea index score (1.00 [0.41-1.59]; 1.01 [0.79-1.22]; 0.82 [0.62-1.02]; 1.00 
[0.49-1.51]); and 24-week rescue medication use (data not available; -0.41 
puffs/day [-0.62 to -0.20]; -0.52 puffs/day [-0.74 to -0.30]; -0.30 puffs/day 
[-0.81 to 0.21]). For 12-week trough FEV1, differences in change from baseline 
(95% credible interval) were -12.8 mL (-39.39 to 13.93), aclidinium versus 
tiotropium; 3.08 mL (-7.58 to 13.69), glycopyrronium versus tiotropium; 22.58 mL 
(-11.58 to 56.97), umeclidinium versus tiotropium; 15.90 mL (-11.60 to 43.15), 
glycopyrronium versus aclidinium; 35.40 mL (-5.06 to 76.07), umeclidinium versus 
aclidinium; and 19.50 mL (-15.30 to 54.38), umeclidinium versus glycopyrronium. 
Limitations included inhaler-related factors and safety; longer-term outcomes 
were not considered.
CONCLUSION: The new LAMAs studied had at least comparable efficacy to 
tiotropium, the established class standard. Choice should depend on physician's 
and patient's preference.

OBJECTIVE: To compare the rate of moderate to severe exacerbations between 
triple therapy and dual therapy or monotherapy in patients with chronic 
obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).
DESIGN: Systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials.
DATA SOURCES: PubMed, Embase, Cochrane databases, and clinical trial registries 
searched from inception to April 2018.
ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA: Randomised controlled trials comparing triple therapy with 
dual therapy or monotherapy in patients with COPD were eligible. Efficacy and 
safety outcomes of interest were also available.
DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS: Data were collected independently. Meta-analyses 
were conducted to calculate rate ratios, hazard ratios, risk ratios, and mean 
differences with 95% confidence intervals. Quality of evidence was summarised in 
accordance with GRADE methodology (grading of recommendations assessment, 
development, and evaluation).
RESULTS: 21 trials (19 publications) were included. Triple therapy consisted of 
a long acting muscarinic antagonist (LAMA), long acting β agonist (LABA), and 
inhaled corticosteroid (ICS). Triple therapy was associated with a significantly 
reduced rate of moderate or severe exacerbations compared with LAMA monotherapy 
(rate ratio 0.71, 95% confidence interval 0.60 to 0.85), LAMA and LABA (0.78, 
0.70 to 0.88), and ICS and LABA (0.77, 0.66 to 0.91). Trough forced expiratory 
volume in 1 second (FEV1) and quality of life were favourable with triple 
therapy. The overall safety profile of triple therapy is reassuring, but 
pneumonia was significantly higher with triple therapy than with dual therapy of 
LAMA and LABA (relative risk 1.53, 95% confidence interval 1.25 to 1.87).
CONCLUSIONS: Use of triple therapy resulted in a lower rate of moderate or 
severe exacerbations of COPD, better lung function, and better health related 
quality of life than dual therapy or monotherapy in patients with advanced COPD.

OBJECTIVE: To compare the safety and effectiveness of long-acting β-antagonists 
(LABA), long-acting antimuscarinic agents (LAMA) and inhaled corticosteroids 
(ICS) for managing chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).
SETTING: Systematic review and network meta-analysis (NMA).
PARTICIPANTS: 208 randomised clinical trials (RCTs) including 134,692 adults 
with COPD.
INTERVENTIONS: LABA, LAMA and/or ICS, alone or in combination, versus each other 
or placebo.
PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOMES: The proportion of patients with 
moderate-to-severe exacerbations. The number of patients experiencing mortality, 
pneumonia, serious arrhythmia and cardiovascular-related mortality (CVM) were 
secondary outcomes.
RESULTS: NMA was conducted including 20 RCTs for moderate-to-severe 
exacerbations for 26,141 patients with an exacerbation in the past year. 32 
treatments were effective versus placebo including: tiotropium, 
budesonide/formoterol, salmeterol, indacaterol, fluticasone/salmeterol, 
indacaterol/glycopyrronium, tiotropium/fluticasone/salmeterol and 
tiotropium/budesonide/formoterol. Tiotropium/budesonide/formoterol was most 
effective (99.2% probability of being the most effective according to the 
Surface Under the Cumulative RAnking (SUCRA) curve). NMA was conducted on 
mortality (88 RCTs, 97 526 patients); fluticasone/salmeterol was more effective 
in reducing mortality than placebo, formoterol and fluticasone alone, and was 
the most effective (SUCRA=71%). NMA was conducted on CVM (37 RCTs, 55,156 
patients) and the following were safest: salmeterol versus each OF placebo, 
tiotropium and tiotropium (Soft Mist Inhaler (SMR)); fluticasone versus 
tiotropium (SMR); and salmeterol/fluticasone versus tiotropium and tiotropium 
(SMR). Triamcinolone acetonide was the most harmful (SUCRA=81%). NMA was 
conducted on pneumonia occurrence (54 RCTs, 61 551 patients). 24 treatments were 
more harmful, including 2 that increased risk of pneumonia versus placebo; 
fluticasone and fluticasone/salmeterol. The most harmful agent was 
fluticasone/salmeterol (SUCRA=89%). NMA was conducted for arrhythmia; no 
statistically significant differences between agents were identified.
CONCLUSIONS: Many inhaled agents are available for COPD, some are safer and more 
effective than others. Our results can be used by patients and physicians to 
tailor administration of these agents.

The goals of COPD therapy are to prevent and control symptoms, reduce the 
frequency and severity of exacerbations, and improve exercise tolerance. The 
triple combination therapy of inhaled corticosteroids (ICSs), long-acting beta2 
agonists (LABAs), and long-acting muscarinic antagonists (LAMAs) has become an 
option for maintenance treatment of COPD and as a "step-up" therapy from single 
or double combination treatments. There is evidence that triple combination 
ICS/LABA/LAMA with different inhalers improves lung function, symptoms, and 
health status and reduces exacerbations. A new triple fixed-dose combination of 
extrafine beclomethasone dipropionate (100 µg/puff)/formoterol fumarate (6 
µg/puff)/glycopyrronium bromide (12.5 µg/puff) has been developed as a 
hydrofluoroalkane pressurized metered dose inhaler. Two large pivotal studies 
showed that this extrafine fixed ICS/LABA/LAMA triple combination is superior to 
fixed ICS/LABA combined therapy and also superior to the LAMA tiotropium in 
terms of lung function and exacerbation prevention in COPD patients at risk of 
exacerbation. This review considers the new information provided by these 
clinical trials of extrafine triple therapy and the implications for the 
clinical management of COPD patients.

Parasympathetic activity is increased in patients with chronic obstructive 
pulmonary disease (COPD) and asthma and appears to be the major reversible 
component of airway obstruction. Therefore, treatment with muscarinic receptor 
antagonists is an effective bronchodilator therapy in COPD and also in asthmatic 
patients. In recent years, the accumulating evidence that the cholinergic system 
controls not only contraction by airway smooth muscle but also the functions of 
inflammatory cells and airway epithelial cells has suggested that muscarinic 
receptor antagonists could exert other effects that may be of clinical relevance 
when we must treat a patient suffering from COPD or asthma. There are currently 
six muscarinic receptor antagonists licenced for use in the treatment of COPD, 
the short-acting muscarinic receptor antagonists (SAMAs) ipratropium bromide and 
oxitropium bromide and the long-acting muscarinic receptor antagonists (LAMAs) 
aclidinium bromide, tiotropium bromide, glycopyrronium bromide and umeclidinium 
bromide. Concerns have been raised about possible associations of muscarinic 
receptor antagonists with cardiovascular safety, but the most advanced compounds 
seem to have an improved safety profile. Further beneficial effects of SAMAs and 
LAMAs are seen when added to existing treatments, including LABAs, inhaled 
corticosteroids and phosphodiesterase 4 inhibitors. The importance of tiotropium 
bromide in the maintenance treatment of COPD, and likely in asthma, has spurred 
further research to identify new LAMAs. There are a number of molecules that are 
being identified, but only few have reached the clinical development.

PURPOSE: To assess the comparative efficacy of short-acting muscarinic 
antagonists (SAMAs), long-acting muscarinic antagonists (LAMAs), LAMA in 
combination with long-acting beta-agonists (LABAs; LAMA/LABAs) and inhaled 
corticosteroids (ICS) in combination with LABA (ICS/LABAs) for the maintenance 
treatment of COPD.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We systematically reviewed 74 randomized controlled 
trials (74,832 participants) published up to 15 November 2017, which compared 
any of the interventions (SAMA [ipratropium], LAMA [aclidinium, glycopyrronium, 
tiotropium, umeclidinium], LAMA/LABA [aclidinium/formoterol, 
indacaterol/glycopyrronium, tiotropium/olodaterol, umeclidinium/vilanterol] and 
ICS/LABA [fluticasone/vilanterol, budesonide/formoterol, 
salmeterol/fluticasone]) with each other or with placebo. A random-effects 
network meta-analysis combining direct and indirect evidence was conducted to 
examine the change from baseline in trough FEV1, transition dyspnea index, St 
George's Respiratory Questionnaire and frequency of adverse events at weeks 12 
and 24.
RESULTS: Inconsistency models were not statistically significant for all 
outcomes. LAMAs, LAMA/LABAs and ICS/LABAs led to a significantly greater 
improvement in trough FEV1 compared with placebo and SAMA monotherapy at weeks 
12 and 24. All LAMA/LABAs, except aclidinium/formoterol, were statistically 
significantly better than LAMA monotherapy and ICS/LABAs in improving trough 
FEV1. Among the LAMAs, umeclidinium showed statistically significant improvement 
in trough FEV1 at week 12 compared to tiotropium and glycopyrronium, but the 
results were not clinically significant. LAMA/LABAs had the highest 
probabilities of being ranked the best agents in FEV1 improvement. Similar 
trends were observed for the transition dyspnea index and St George's 
Respiratory Questionnaire outcomes. There were no significant differences in the 
incidences of adverse events among all treatment options.
CONCLUSION: LAMA/LABA showed the greatest improvement in trough FEV1 at weeks 12 
and 24 compared with the other inhaled drug classes, while SAMA showed the least 
improvement. There were no significant differences among the LAMAs and 
LAMA/LABAs within their respective classes.

BACKGROUND: Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a respiratory 
condition causing accumulation of mucus in the airways, cough, and 
breathlessness; the disease is progressive and is the fourth most common cause 
of death worldwide. Current treatment strategies for COPD are multi-modal and 
aim to reduce morbidity and mortality and increase patients' quality of life by 
slowing disease progression and preventing exacerbations. Fixed-dose 
combinations (FDCs) of a long-acting beta2-agonist (LABA) plus a long-acting 
muscarinic antagonist (LAMA) delivered via a single inhaler are approved by 
regulatory authorities in the USA, Europe, and Japan for the treatment of COPD. 
Several LABA/LAMA FDCs are available and recent meta-analyses have clarified 
their utility versus their mono-components in COPD. Evaluation of the efficacy 
and safety of once-daily LABA/LAMA FDCs versus placebo will facilitate the 
comparison of different FDCs in future network meta-analyses.
OBJECTIVES: We assessed the evidence for once-daily LABA/LAMA combinations 
(delivered in a single inhaler) versus placebo on clinically meaningful outcomes 
in patients with stable COPD.
SEARCH METHODS: We identified trials from Cochrane Airways' Specialised Register 
(CASR) and also conducted a search of the US National Institutes of Health 
Ongoing Trials Register ClinicalTrials.gov (www.clinicaltrials.gov) and the 
World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform 
(apps.who.int/trialsearch). We searched CASR and trial registries from their 
inception to 3 December 2018; we imposed no restriction on language of 
publication.
SELECTION CRITERIA: We included parallel-group and cross-over randomised 
controlled trials (RCTs) comparing once-daily LABA/LAMA FDC versus placebo. We 
included studies reported as full-text, those published as abstract only, and 
unpublished data. We excluded very short-term trials with a duration of less 
than 3 weeks. We included adults (≥ 40 years old) with a diagnosis of stable 
COPD. We included studies that allowed participants to continue using their ICS 
during the trial as long as the ICS was not part of the randomised treatment.
DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two review authors independently screened the 
search results to determine included studies, extracted data on prespecified 
outcomes of interest, and assessed the risk of bias of included studies; we 
resolved disagreements by discussion with a third review author. Where possible, 
we used a random-effects model to meta-analyse extracted data. We rated all 
outcomes using the GRADE (Grades of Recommendation, Assessment, Development and 
Evaluation) system and presented results in 'Summary of findings' tables.
MAIN RESULTS: We identified and included 22 RCTs randomly assigning 8641 people 
with COPD to either once-daily LABA/LAMA FDC (6252 participants) or placebo 
(3819 participants); nine studies had a cross-over design. Studies had a 
duration of between three and 52 weeks (median 12 weeks). The mean age of 
participants across the included studies ranged from 59 to 65 years and in 21 of 
22 studies, participants had GOLD stage II or III COPD. Concomitant inhaled 
corticosteroid (ICS) use was permitted in all of the included studies (where 
stated); across the included studies, between 28% to 58% of participants were 
using ICS at baseline. Six studies evaluated the once-daily combination of 
IND/GLY (110/50 μg), seven studies evaluated TIO/OLO (2.5/5 or 5/5 μg), eight 
studies evaluated UMEC/VI (62.5/5, 125/25 or 500/25 μg) and one study evaluated 
ACD/FOR (200/6, 200/12 or 200/18 μg); all LABA/LAMA combinations were compared 
with placebo.The risk of bias was generally considered to be low or unknown 
(insufficient detail provided), with only one study per domain considered to 
have a high risk of bias except for the domain 'other bias' which was determined 
to be at high risk of bias in four studies (in three studies, disease severity 
was greater at baseline in participants receiving LABA/LAMA compared with 
participants receiving placebo, which would be expected to shift the treatment 
effect in favour of placebo).Compared to the placebo, the pooled results for the 
primary outcomes for the once-daily LABA/LAMA arm were as follows: all-cause 
mortality, OR 1.88 (95% CI 0.81 to 4.36, low-certainty evidence); all-cause 
serious adverse events (SAEs), OR 1.06 (95% CI 0.88 to 1.28, high-certainty 
evidence); acute exacerbations of COPD (AECOPD), OR 0.53 (95% CI 0.36 to 0.78, 
moderate-certainty evidence); adjusted St George's Respiratory Questionnaire 
(SGRQ) score, MD -4.08 (95% CI -4.80 to -3.36, high-certainty evidence); 
proportion of SGRQ responders, OR 1.75 (95% CI 1.54 to 1.99). Compared with 
placebo, the pooled results for the secondary outcomes for the once-daily 
LABA/LAMA arm were as follows: adjusted trough forced expiratory volume in one 
second (FEV1), MD 0.20 L (95% CI 0.19 to 0.21, moderate-certainty evidence); 
adjusted peak FEV1, MD 0.31 L (95% CI 0.29 to 0.32, moderate-certainty 
evidence); and all-cause AEs, OR 0.95 (95% CI 0.86 to 1.04; high-certainty 
evidence). No studies reported data for the 6-minute walk test. The results were 
generally consistent across subgroups for different LABA/LAMA combinations and 
doses.
AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Compared with placebo, once-daily LABA/LAMA (either 
IND/GLY, UMEC/VI or TIO/OLO) via a combination inhaler is associated with a 
clinically significant improvement in lung function and health-related quality 
of life in patients with mild-to-moderate COPD; UMEC/VI appears to reduce the 
rate of exacerbations in this population. These conclusions are supported by 
moderate or high certainty evidence based on studies with an observation period 
of up to one year.

BACKGROUND: The long-acting muscarinic antagonists umeclidinium (UMEC) and 
tiotropium (TIO) are approved once-daily maintenance therapies for COPD. This 
study investigated the efficacy and safety of UMEC versus TIO in COPD.
METHODS: This was a 12-week, multicenter, randomized, blinded, double-dummy, 
parallel-group, non-inferiority study. Patients were randomized 1:1 to UMEC 62.5 
μg plus placebo or TIO 18 μg plus placebo. The primary end point was trough 
forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) at day 85 (non-inferiority margin 
-50 mL; per-protocol [PP] population). Other end points included weighted mean 
FEV1 over 0-24 and 12-24 hours post-dose. Patient-reported outcomes comprised 
Transition Dyspnea Index score, St George's Respiratory Questionnaire total 
score, and COPD Assessment Test score. Adverse events were also assessed.
RESULTS: In total, 1,017 patients were randomized to treatment. In the PP 
population, 489 and 487 patients received UMEC and TIO, respectively. In the PP 
population, change from baseline in trough FEV1 was greater with UMEC versus TIO 
at day 85, meeting non-inferiority and superiority margins (difference: 59 mL; 
95% confidence interval [CI]: 29-88; P<0.001). Similar results were observed in 
the intent-to-treat analysis of trough FEV1 at day 85 (53 mL, 95% CI: 25-81; 
P<0.001). Improvements in weighted mean FEV1 over 0-24 hours post-dose at day 84 
were similar with UMEC and TIO but significantly greater with UMEC versus TIO 
over 12-24 hours post-dose (70 mL; P=0.015). Clinically meaningful improvements 
in Transition Dyspnea Index and St George's Respiratory Questionnaire were 
observed with both treatments at all time points. No differences were observed 
between UMEC and TIO in patient-reported outcomes. Overall incidences of adverse 
events were similar for UMEC and TIO.
CONCLUSION: UMEC 62.5 μg demonstrated superior efficacy to TIO 18 μg on the 
primary end point of trough FEV1 at day 85. Safety profiles were similar for 
both treatments.

Several long-acting bronchodilators have been developed and are widely used as 
first-line treatment in patients with stable chronic obstructive pulmonary 
disease (COPD). However, the initial choice of therapy is still uncertain. The 
aim of this study was to examine the clinical efficacy and safety of long-acting 
muscarinic antagonist (LAMA) and long-acting beta2-agonist (LABA) in patients 
with stable COPD. We searched several databases and manufacturers' websites to 
identify relevant randomized clinical trials for meta-analysis. Outcomes of 
interest were trough forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1 ), acute 
exacerbations, transitional dyspnoea index (TDI) score, St George's Respiratory 
Questionnaire (SGRQ) score and adverse events. Sixteen trials with a total of 
22 872 patients were included in this study. Compared with LABA, LAMA were 
associated with a greater reduction in acute exacerbations (OR: 0.84, 95% CI: 
0.74-0.94, P = 0.003) and fewer adverse events (OR: 0.92, 95% CI: 0.86-0.97, 
P = 0.005). There were no significant differences in trough FEV1 , TDI and SGRQ 
scores. In patients with stable COPD, LAMA were associated with a greater 
reduction in acute exacerbations and fewer adverse effects compared with LABA.

BACKGROUND: The ability of a long-acting muscarinic antagonist (LAMA) and 
long-acting beta 2 agonists (LABAs; long-acting bronchodilators, LABDs) with or 
without inhaled corticosteroids (ICSs) to reduce early readmission in 
hospitalized patients with COPD is unknown.
METHODS: We studied a 5% sample of Medicare beneficiaries enrolled in Medicare 
parts A, B and D and hospitalized for COPD in 2011. We examined prescriptions 
filled for LABDs with or without ICSs (LABDs±ICSs) within 90 days prior to and 
30 days after hospitalization. Primary outcome was the 30-day readmission rate 
between "users" and "nonusers" of LABDs±ICSs. Propensity score matching and 
sensitivity analysis were performed by limiting analysis to patients 
hospitalized for acute exacerbation of COPD (AECOPD). Among 6,066 patients 
hospitalized for COPD, 3,747 (61.8%) used LABDs±ICSs during the specified 
period. The "user" and "nonuser" groups had similar rates of all-cause emergency 
room (ER) visits and readmissions within 30 days of discharge date (22.4% vs 
20.7%, P-value 0.11; 18.0% vs 17.8%, P-value 0.85, respectively). However, the 
"users" had higher rates of COPD-related ER visits (5.3% vs 3.4%, P-value 
0.0006), higher adjusted odds ratio (aOR) 1.47 (95% CI, 1.11-1.93) and 
readmission (7.8% vs 5.0%, P-value <0.0001 and aOR 1.48 [95% CI, 1.18-1.86]) 
than "nonusers". After propensity score matching, the aOR of COPD-related ER 
visits was 1.45 (95% CI, 1.07-1.96) and that of readmission was 1.34 (95% CI, 
1.04-1.73). The results were similar when restricted to patients hospitalized 
for AECOPD.
CONCLUSION: Use of LABDs±ICSs did not reduce 30-day readmissions in patients 
hospitalized for COPD.

BACKGROUND: A number of long-acting muscarinic antagonist (LAMA)/long-acting 
β2-agonist (LABA) fixed-dose combinations (FDCs) for treatment of 
moderate-to-very severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) have 
recently become available, but none have been directly compared in head-to-head 
randomized controlled trials (RCTs). The purpose of this study was to assess the 
relative clinical benefit of all currently available LAMA/LABA FDCs using a 
Bayesian network meta-analysis (NMA).
METHODS: A systematic literature review identified RCTs investigating the 
efficacy, safety and quality of life associated with licensed LAMA/LABA FDCs for 
the treatment of moderate-to-very severe COPD. RCTs were screened for inclusion 
in the NMA using prespecified eligibility criteria. Data were extracted for 
outcomes of interest, including change in trough forced expiratory volume in 1 
second (tFEV1) from baseline, St. George Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ) 
percentage of responders, Transition Dyspnea Index (TDI) percentage of 
responders, change in SGRQ score from baseline, change in TDI focal score from 
baseline, moderate-to-severe exacerbations, all-cause discontinuation, and 
discontinuation due to adverse events.
RESULTS: Following screening, a total of 27 trials from 26 publications with 
30,361 subjects were eligible for inclusion in the NMA. Nonsignificant results 
were seen in most analyses comparing efficacy, exacerbations and discontinuation 
rates of included LAMA/LABA FDCs (i.e. aclidinium/formoterol 400/12 µg, 
glycopyrronium/indacaterol 110/50 µg, tiotropium + olodaterol 5/5 µg, 
umeclidinium/vilanterol 62.5/25 µg). Meta-regression controlling for 
post-bronchodilator percentage of tFEV1 predicted at baseline as well as 
meta-regression adjusting for concomitant use of inhaled corticosteroids at 
baseline was performed to assess the magnitude of effect modification and 
produced similar results as observed in the base case analysis.
CONCLUSION: All LAMA/LABA FDCs were found to have similar efficacy and safety. 
Definitive assessment of the relative efficacy of different treatments can only 
be performed through direct comparison in head-to-head RCTs. In the absence of 
such data, this indirect comparison may be of value in clinical and health 
economic decision-making.

BACKGROUND: The wide availability of long-acting muscarinic antagonist 
(LAMA)/long-acting β2-agonist (LABA) fixed-dose combinations (FDCs) in the 
absence of head-to-head comparative pragmatic trials makes it difficult to 
choose which combination should be used. Therefore, we carried out a systematic 
review with meta-analysis that incorporated the data from trials lasting at 
least 3 months to evaluate the effectiveness of LAMA/LABA FDCs for COPD 
treatment.
METHODS: Randomized controlled trials were identified by searching different 
databases of published and unpublished trials. We aimed to assess the influence 
of LAMA/LABA combinations on trough FEV1, transitional dyspnea index, St. 
George's Respiratory Questionnaire, and cardiac safety vs monocomponents.
RESULTS: Fourteen papers and one congress abstract with 23,168 patients with 
COPD (combinations, n = 10,328; monocomponents, n = 12,840) were included in 
this study. Our results showed that all LAMA/LABA combinations were always more 
effective than the LAMA or LABA alone in terms of the improvement in trough 
FEV1. Although there was not significant difference among LAMA/LABA 
combinations, we identified a gradient of effectiveness among the currently 
available LAMA/LABA FDCs. LAMA/LABA combinations also improved both transitional 
dyspnea index and St. George's Respiratory Questionnaire scores, but did not 
increase the cardiovascular risk when compared with monocomponents.
CONCLUSIONS: The gradient of effectiveness emerging from this meta-analysis is 
merely a weak indicator of possible differences between the various LAMA/LABA 
FDCs. Only direct comparisons will document if a specific LAMA/LABA FDC is 
better than the other. In the meanwhile, we believe it is only proper to 
consider that dual bronchodilation is better than a LAMA or a LABA alone, 
regardless of the drugs used.

Evidence-based guidelines recommend inhaled long-acting anti-muscarinic agents 
(LAMAs) as first-line maintenance therapy for symptomatic patients with COPD. 
Several LAMAs are now available for use either as monotherapy or in combination 
with other COPD medications, including long-acting β2-agonists (LABAs) or 
inhaled corticosteroids (ICS). The efficacy and long-term safety of these 
medications have been evaluated in multiple clinical trials and real-life 
studies. This review evaluates the evidence available on the safety of existing 
LAMAs alone or in combination with LABAs and ICS in patients with COPD.

BACKGROUND: Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is the fourth leading 
cause of death in Canada. Most patients with COPD receive long-term treatment 
with long acting anticholinergics (LAAC) and/or long-acting β2-agonists (LABA). 
Adverse events (AEs) are also likely during long-term treatment with these 
medications.
OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the prevalence of AEs in COPD patients on LAAC and LABA 
in a real-world setting.
METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional study of patients enrolled in the 
Registre de Données en Santé Pulmonaire (RESP) database, which records 
information on Canadian patients with asthma or COPD. COPD Patients completed a 
questionnaire about AEs that may be associated with LAAC and/or LABA. The 
prevalence of AEs and the corresponding 95% CI were calculated for three groups 
of patients (LAAC + LABA, LAAC alone, and LABA alone).
RESULTS: Most patients with COPD (n = 154) were current or ex-smokers. Over 50% 
of patients were overweight or obese, and had an annual family income of less or 
equal to $42,000. Dry mouth (55.2%, 40%, and 43.5%) and dry throat (33.6%, 
26.7%, and 34.8%) occurred most of the time or always in the LAAC + LABA, LAAC, 
and LABA groups, respectively. Headache was reported by 17.4% of patients in the 
LABA group, but less than 11.2% in the other groups.
CONCLUSION: AEs reported in this study deserve clinical attention because they 
may negatively affect quality of life and treatment adherence of COPD patients.

Comment in
    Eur Respir J. 2017 May 23;49(5):

The cardiovascular risk of concurrently using long-acting β2-agonists (LABAs) 
and anticholinergics (LAMAs) in COPD is uncertain. We assessed the comparative 
cardiovascular and cerebrovascular safety of adding a second long-acting 
bronchodilator in patients with COPD.We identified a cohort of COPD patients, 
new users of LABA or the LAMA tiotropium during 2002-2012, from the UK Clinical 
Practice Research Datalink. Using high-dimensional propensity scores, each 
patient adding a second bronchodilator was matched with a patient who remained 
on monotherapy. Patients were followed for 1 year for the occurrence of acute 
myocardial infarction (AMI), stroke, heart failure and arrhythmia.The cohorts 
included up to 31 174 patients adding a bronchodilator matched to 31 174 
patients remaining on bronchodilator monotherapy. Adding a long-acting 
bronchodilator, compared to remaining on monotherapy, was not associated with an 
increased risk of AMI (hazard ratio (HR) 1.12, 95% CI 0.92-1.36), stroke (HR 
0.87, 95% CI 0.69-1.10) or arrhythmia (HR 1.05, 95% CI 0.81-1.36), but the risk 
was elevated for heart failure (HR 1.16, 95% CI 1.03-1.30).Adding a second 
long-acting bronchodilator in the real-world-setting treatment of COPD does not 
increase the risk of most cardiovascular events. The modest increase for heart 
failure warrants further investigation.

OBJECTIVE: To determine whether long-acting muscarinic antagonists (LAMAs) 
provide superior therapeutic effects over long-acting β2 agonists (LABAs) for 
preventing COPD exacerbations.
METHODS: This was a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized clinical 
trials involving patients with stable, moderate to severe COPD according to the 
Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease criteria, treated with a 
LAMA (i.e., tiotropium bromide, aclidinium, or glycopyrronium), followed for at 
least 12 weeks and compared with controls using a LABA in isolation or in 
combination with a corticosteroid.
RESULTS: A total of 2,622 studies were analyzed for possible inclusion on the 
basis of their title and abstract; 9 studies (17,120 participants) were included 
in the analysis. In comparison with LABAs, LAMAs led to a greater decrease in 
the exacerbation rate ratio (relative risk [RR] = 0.88; 95% CI: 0.84-0.93]; a 
lower proportion of patients who experienced at least one exacerbation (RR = 
0.90; 95% CI: 0.87-0.94; p < 0.00001); a lower risk of exacerbation-related 
hospitalizations (RR = 0.78; 95% CI: 0.69-0.87; p < 0.0001); and a lower number 
of serious adverse events (RR = 0.81; 95% CI: 0.67-0.96; p = 0.0002). The 
overall quality of evidence was moderate for all outcomes.
CONCLUSIONS: The major findings of this systematic review and meta-analysis were 
that LAMAs significantly reduced the exacerbation rate (exacerbation 
episodes/year), as well as the number of exacerbation episodes, of 
hospitalizations, and of serious adverse events.

OBJETIVO: Determinar se long-acting muscarinic antagonists (LAMAs, antagonistas 
muscarínicos de longa duração) são superiores a long-acting β2 agonists (LABAs, 
β2-agonistas de longa duração) na prevenção de exacerbações da DPOC.
MÉTODOS: Revisão sistemática e meta-análise de ensaios clínicos controlados 
aleatórios com pacientes com DPOC estável, de moderada a grave, conforme os 
critérios da Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease, tratados 
com LAMA (brometo de tiotrópio, aclidínio ou glicopirrônio), acompanhados 
durante pelo menos 12 semanas e comparados a controles que usaram LABA 
isoladamente ou com um corticosteroide.
RESULTADOS: Foram analisados 2.622 estudos para possível inclusão com base em 
seu título e resumo; 9 estudos (17.120 participantes) foram incluídos na 
análise. Em comparação com LABAs, LAMAs resultaram em maior diminuição da razão 
da taxa de exacerbações [risco relativo (RR) = 0,88; IC95%: 0,84-0,93]; menor 
proporção de pacientes que apresentaram pelo menos uma exacerbação (RR = 0,90; 
IC95%: 0,87-0,94; p < 0,00001); menor risco de hospitalizações em virtude de 
exacerbação da doença (RR = 0,78; IC95%: 0,69-0,87; p < 0,0001) e menor número 
de eventos adversos sérios (RR = 0,81; IC95%: 0,67-0,96; p = 0,0002). A 
qualidade geral das evidências foi moderada para todos os desfechos.
CONCLUSÕES: O principal achado desta revisão sistemática e meta-análise foi que 
LAMAs reduziram significativamente a taxa de exacerbações (episódios de 
exacerbação/ano), os episódios de exacerbação, as hospitalizações e os eventos 
adversos sérios.

BACKGROUND: A large body of evidence suggests that long-acting β2-adrenoceptor 
agonist (LABA)/long-acting muscarinic antagonist (LAMA) combinations induce a 
strong synergistic bronchodilatory effect in human isolated airways. Moreover, a 
recent post hoc analysis demonstrated clinical synergism between LABAs and 
LAMAs, which induces a synergistic improvement not only in lung function but 
also in dyspnea in COPD patients.
AIM: The aim of this study is to examine the baseline factors related to 
improvement in lung function or clinical symptoms that results from the 
administration of LAMA or LAMA/LABA and to compare the differences in 
improvement in lung function or clinical symptoms between LAMA and LAMA/LABA.
METHODS: Among 829 patients with COPD who were treated with LAMA or LAMA/LABA in 
our hospital, 112 patients (aged 40-89 years) matched the criteria. Of these 112 
patients, 71 received LAMA (LAMA group) and 41 received LAMA/LABA (LAMA/LABA 
group) as the initial treatment. Various examination results such as lung 
function test values, symptom change, and frequency of exacerbations were 
compared between the two groups.
RESULTS: Compared with the monotherapy, the combination therapy significantly 
improved the FEV1, inspiratory capacity (IC), and total COPD assessment test 
(CAT) scores. Comparing the improvement in each domain of the CAT produced by 
the combination therapy with that of the monotherapy, larger improvements were 
found for the domains of going out and sleeping. The frequency of exacerbations 
during the 24 weeks was significantly lower in the combination therapy group 
than in the LAMA monotherapy group (P=0.034). Although no relationship was found 
between improvement in FEV1 and any pretreatment factors in the LAMA/LABA group, 
the improvement in the CAT score was strongly related to the baseline CAT score, 
smoking index, and air trapping index (P-value <1×10-4).
CONCLUSION: In this study of clinical practice, we found that LAMA/LABA 
combination therapy improved the clinical symptoms of COPD and IC and that the 
effects of the combination therapy were consistent with those observed in 
previous clinical trials.

OBJECTIVES: The main objectives of this study, based on a large cohort of German 
COPD patients, were to assess the level of non-persistence (NP) and 
non-adherence (NA) with long-acting COPD inhaler treatment and to describe 
factors that may be associated with NP and NA.
METHODS: This was a retrospective cohort analysis based on claims data provided 
by a German statutory health insurance fund (years 2010-2012). NP was analyzed 
for treatment-naïve patients only; it was defined as a gap of >90 days in 
medication availability. With regard to NA, first the overall yearly medication 
possession ratio (MPR) was analyzed, NA was defined as MPR<80%. Secondly, 
adherence was explored only for the period in which a patient continued therapy 
with a long-acting COPD agent (no gap>90 days).
RESULTS: 45,937 COPD patients who received at least one prescription of any 
long-acting COPD agent were identified (mean age 71.4 years; 45.2% female). 
Among these, 22,276 (42.4%) were classified as newly treated. The percentage of 
NP patients after 12 months was 65.3% on an overall patient level. 
Agent-specific NP rates were: 58.5% for LABA, 47.9% for LAMA, 78.0% for ICS, and 
69.4% for single-device LABA/ICS combination treatment. The overall 12-month MPR 
across all agent classes on a patient level was 57.9% (70.0% of patients 
classified as non-adherent). During periods of general treatment continuation, 
the mean MPR/NA rates were 85.0%/30.1% (patient level across all agents), 
89.3%/28.2% (LABA), 92.1%/16.2% (LAMA), 84.2%/43.8% (ICS) and 84.1%/42.8% 
(LABA/ICS combination). In the Cox regression analyses, several factors like 
female gender, higher CCI or lower number of specialist' visits were associated 
with earlier discontinuation of therapy. In comparison to LABA therapy, LAMA 
therapy was less likely to be associated with early NP, whereas patients who 
initiated ICS therapy or a single-device LABA/ICS combination therapy faced a 
higher NP risk.
CONCLUSIONS: In German COPD patients, persistence and adherence with respect to 
long-acting bronchodilator therapy is poor. Approximately two thirds of patients 
fail to continue treatment after 12 months. In addition, about one third 
implement their treatment poorly during periods of general therapy continuation.

Medicine, Yokohama, Japan.

Some trials have been conducted to compare long-acting muscarinic antagonist 
(LAMA) + long-acting beta agonist (LABA) versus LABA + inhaled corticosteroids 
(ICS) for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), but no meta-analysis 
were reported. Two investigators independently searched for eligible articles 
using the PubMed, Web of Science and Cochrane databases. Articles in authors' 
reference files were also regarded as candidates. The eligibility criteria for 
the current meta-analysis were original trials written in English comparing the 
impact of LAMA + LABA and LABA + ICS for COPD patients. A pooled value for the 
continuous value was calculated using the genetic inverse variance method for 
mean difference. Incidence of events was evaluated using the odds ratio (OR). 
Minimal clinically important difference were 50 mL for forced expiratory volume 
in 1 s (FEV1 ), four points for St George Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ) and 
one point for transition dyspnoea index (TDI). We included seven randomized 
controlled trials and one cross-over trial with follow-up period of 6-26 weeks. 
Compared with LABA + ICS, LAMA + LABA led to significantly greater improvements 
of trough FEV1 by 71 (95% CI: 48-95) mL, TDI by 0.38 points (95% CI: 0.17-0.58), 
less exacerbations with an OR of 0.77 (95% CI: 0.62-0.96) and less pneumonia 
with an OR of 0.28 (95% CI: 0.12-0.68). Frequencies of any adverse event, 
serious adverse event, adverse event leading to discontinuation, all-cause death 
and change of total score of SGRQ were not different in both arms. LAMA + LABA 
might be a better option for treating COPD than LABA + ICS.

BACKGROUND: Tiotropium + olodaterol improves lung function and symptoms compared 
to monotherapies in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). The OTEMTO 1 
and 2 studies investigated the effects of tiotropium + olodaterol on lung 
function and health-related quality of life compared to placebo in patients with 
moderate to severe COPD.
METHODS: In these two replicate, double-blind, parallel-group, 
placebo-controlled trials, patients were randomised to receive tiotropium + 
olodaterol 5/5 μg, 2.5/5 μg, tiotropium 5 μg or placebo for 12 weeks, via the 
Respimat(®) inhaler. Primary end points were St George's Respiratory 
Questionnaire (SGRQ) total score, forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1) area 
under the curve from 0 to 3 h (AUC0-3) response and trough FEV1 response.
RESULTS: In OTEMTO 1 and 2, tiotropium + olodaterol 5/5 μg improved SGRQ total 
score by 4.89 (95% confidence interval [CI] -6.90, -2.88) and 4.56 (95% CI 
-6.50, -2.63) units versus placebo (both p < 0.0001), and 2.49 (95% CI -4.47, 
-0.51; p < 0.05) and 1.72 (95% CI -3.63, 0.19) units versus tiotropium 5 μg. 
Tiotropium + olodaterol 2.5/5 μg significantly improved SGRQ score compared to 
placebo. Both doses significantly improved FEV1 AUC0-3 response compared to 
placebo and tiotropium 5 μg. Tiotropium + olodaterol 5/5 and 2.5/5 μg also 
significantly improved trough FEV1 response compared to placebo (both studies) 
and separated from tiotropium 5 μg in OTEMTO 2. Adverse-event incidence was 
similar between treatment groups.
CONCLUSION: Tiotropium + olodaterol improved lung function and quality of life 
compared to placebo and tiotropium 5 μg.

A combination of long acting anticholinergic agents (LAACs) and long-acting 
β2-adrenergic receptor agonist (LABA) is effective in improving lung function in 
chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) compared with monotherapy. However, 
evidence on whether this combination increases the incidence of stroke or other 
cardiac events remains sparse. The objective of the present study was to 
investigate the incidence of stroke and other cardiovascular diseases in COPD 
patients treated with LAAC, LABA, or a combination of the 2.We conducted this 
population-based study using the Taiwan National Health Insurance Research 
Database (1997-2008), identifying COPD patients and their prescribed medication 
from the International Classification of Disease, Ninth Revision codes 490-492 
or 496. A multivariate Cox proportional-hazards model was used to compare the 
risk of stroke and other cardiovascular diseases over the 11-year period after 
treatment with LAAC or LABA only or in combination.Of the 596 COPD patients 
(mean age 70 y), 196 were treated with LAAC, 318 with LABA, and 82 were treated 
with a combination. The overall incidence of stroke (8.53%) significantly 
increased in the combination group compared with LAAC (2.04%) or LABA (1.26%) 
only. In the Cox regression analysis, the adjusted hazard ratio over the 11-year 
survey period for stroke in patients treated with the combination compared with 
LABA only was 1.04 (95% confidence interval, 1.06-2.99) and for LAAC, it was 
0.31 (95% confidence interval, 0.02-2.32).This cohort study using a large health 
insurance database showed that treating patients with COPD, with a combination 
of LAAC and LABA, may be associated with an increased hazard of stroke compared 
with treatment with either agent alone. We should be particularly cautious about 
comedication of LAAC and LABA in patients with COPD.

BACKGROUND: The place of long-acting β agonist/long-acting muscarinic antagonist 
(LABA/LAMA) combinations in stable patients with COPD is not well defined. The 
purpose of this study was to systematically review the efficacy and safety of 
LABA/LAMA combinations.
METHODS: Several databases and manufacturers' websites were searched for 
relevant clinical trials. Randomised control trials, at least 12 weeks duration, 
comparing a LABA/LAMA combination with placebo and/or monotherapy were included. 
The data were pooled using a network as well as a traditional direct comparison 
meta-analysis.
RESULTS: Twenty-three trials with a total of 27 172 patients were included in 
the analysis. LABA/LAMA combinations were associated with a greater improvement 
in lung function, St. George's Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ) score, and 
Transitional Dyspnoea Index (TDI) than monotherapies. LABA/LAMA combinations 
were associated with a significantly greater proportion of SGRQ and TDI 
responders than monotherapies (OR 1.23 (95% credible interval (CrI) 1.06-1.39), 
OR 1.34 (95% CrI 1.19-1.50) versus LABAs and OR 1.24 (95% CrI 1.11-1.36), OR 
1.31 (95% CrI 1.18-1.46) versus LAMAs, respectively) and fewer 
moderate-to-severe exacerbations compared with LABAs (HR 0.82 (95% CrI 
0.73-0.93)), but not when compared with LAMAs (HR 0.92 (95% CrI 0.84-1.00)). 
There were no statistically significant differences associated with LABA/LAMA 
combinations compared with monotherapies in safety outcomes as well as in severe 
exacerbations.
CONCLUSIONS: The combination therapy was the most effective strategy in 
improving lung function, quality of life, symptom scores and moderate-to-severe 
exacerbation rates, and had similar effects on safety outcomes and severe 
exacerbations as compared with monotherapies.

BACKGROUND: Revefenacin is a once-daily long-acting muscarinic antagonist (LAMA) 
in clinical development for the treatment of patients with chronic obstructive 
pulmonary disease (COPD). In a dose-ranging study, nebulized once-daily 
revefenacin had a long duration of action in patients after 7 days' 
administration of doses up to 700 μg. In this multiple-dose study, the 
bronchodilation efficacy and adverse events profile were characterized in 
patients administered nebulized revefenacin once daily for 28 days.
METHODS: A total of 355 COPD patients (mean age 62 years, mean forced expiratory 
volume in 1 s [FEV1] 44% of predicted) were randomized in a double-blind, 
placebo-controlled parallel group study. Inhaled corticosteroids as well as 
short-acting bronchodilators were permitted. Once-daily treatments (44, 88, 175 
or 350 μg revefenacin or matching placebo) were administered by a standard jet 
nebulizer, for 28 days. The primary endpoint was change from baseline in D28 
trough FEV1, and secondary endpoints included weighted mean FEV1 over 0 to 24 h 
and rescue medication (albuterol) use. Safety evaluations included adverse 
events, laboratory assessments, electrocardiograms and 24-h Holter profiles.
RESULTS: Revefenacin (88, 175 and 350 μg) significantly improved D28 trough FEV1 
over placebo (187.4, 166.6 and 170.6 mL, respectively, all p < 0.001); 44 μg 
produced a sub-therapeutic response. At doses ≥88 μg, more than 80% of patients 
achieved at least a 100-mL increase from baseline FEV1 in the first 4 h post 
dose compared with 33% of placebo patients. For doses ≥88 μg, D28 24 h weighted 
mean differences from placebo for FEV1 were numerically similar to respective 
trough FEV1 values, indicating bronchodilation was sustained for 24 h post dose. 
Doses ≥88 μg reduced the average number of albuterol puffs/day by more than one 
puff/day. The 350 μg dose did not demonstrate additional efficacy over that 
observed with 175 μg revefenacin. Revefenacin was generally well tolerated, with 
minimal reports of systemic anti-cholinergic effects.
CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that 88 and 175 μg revefenacin are appropriate 
doses for use in longer-term safety and efficacy trials. Revefenacin offers the 
potential for the first once-daily LAMA for nebulization in patients with COPD 
who require or prefer a nebulized drug delivery option.

BACKGROUND: Dual bronchodilation with a long-acting muscarinic antagonist 
(LAMA)/long-acting β2-agonist (LABA) fixed-dose combination (FDC) is an 
established treatment strategy for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). 
The relative efficacy and safety of glycopyrrolate/formoterol fumarate metered 
dose inhaler (GFF MDI 18/9.6 μg) in patients with moderate-to-very severe COPD, 
compared with other licensed LAMA/LABA FDCs, was investigated using an 
integrated Bayesian network meta-analysis (NMA).
METHODS: A systematic literature review and subsequent screening process 
identified randomized controlled trials of ⩾10 weeks' duration that enrolled 
patients aged ⩾40 years with moderate-to-very severe COPD and included at least 
one LAMA/LABA FDC or open LAMA + LABA treatment arm. NMAs were conducted for 
outcomes including change from baseline in forced expiratory volume in 1 s 
(FEV1), St George's Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ), and transition dyspnea 
index (TDI) parameters, annualized rate of exacerbations, use of rescue 
medication, adverse events, and all-cause withdrawals. Meta-regression and 
sensitivity analyses accounted for heterogeneity across studies.
RESULTS: In total, 29 studies including 34,617 patients contributed to the NMA 
for efficacy or safety outcomes at week 24 or exacerbations. For all LAMA/LABA 
FDCs with data available, significantly greater improvements in FEV1 [trough, 
peak, and area under the curve (AUC)0-4], SGRQ total score and TDI focal score 
at week 24, and annualized rate of moderate-to-severe exacerbations, were 
observed versus placebo. Where indirect comparisons were possible, differences 
between GFF MDI and other LAMA/LABA FDCs were small relative to established 
margins of clinical relevance, and not statistically significant. The safety and 
tolerability profile of GFF MDI was consistent with other LAMA/LABA FDCs and 
placebo. The results of the meta-regression were generally similar to the base 
case.
CONCLUSIONS: GFF MDI demonstrated comparable efficacy and safety outcomes to 
other LAMA/LABA FDCs. Personalization of treatment choice within the class on 
the basis of other factors such as patient preference may be appropriate.

Triple inhaled therapy for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) consists 
of an inhaled corticosteroid (ICS), a long-acting β2-agonist (LABA) and a 
long-acting muscarinic antagonist (LAMA) taken in combination. Triple therapy is 
recommended by the Global initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) 
for patients who experience recurrent exacerbations despite treatment with 
either a dual bronchodilator (preferred initial therapy) or LABA/ICS combination 
(alternative initial therapy). Although there is evidence for the greater 
efficacy of triple therapy compared with LABA/ICS and LAMA monotherapy with 
regards to improved lung function, health status, and exacerbation rate, the 
efficacy of triple therapy when compared with dual bronchodilation (LABA/LAMA) 
is as yet unknown. As ICS use is associated with an increased risk of developing 
pneumonia, it is important to assess the risk/benefit ratio of triple therapy on 
an individual basis, and identify patients most likely to benefit. The role of 
elevated blood eosinophils as a biomarker for the identification of candidates 
for ICS treatment is currently debated, and further prospective evidence is 
required. This review assesses evidence for the efficacy and safety of triple 
therapy and postulates on the prospective evidence from ongoing studies. The 
potential for treating patients who experience further exacerbations on dual 
bronchodilation according to phenotype is also considered, as well as withdrawal 
of ICS from triple therapy in patients who are unlikely to benefit.

BACKGROUND: No studies have examined adherence or persistence to long-acting 
anticholinergics (LAAC) treatment episodes in patients with chronic obstructive 
pulmonary disease (COPD).
OBJECTIVE: To estimate 1-year adherence and 5-year persistence to LAAC during 
treatment episodes, and the likelihood of initiating a subsequent treatment 
episode.
METHODS: A retrospective cohort of LAAC-treated COPD patients was reconstructed 
from Quebec databases. A treatment episode was initiated at cohort entry, 
defined as the first LAAC prescription date on/after the first COPD diagnosis 
date recorded between October 1, 2003, and March 31, 2014. We identified a 
subsequent treatment episode up to 5 years after the end of the episode 
initiated at cohort entry. We measured adherence as the proportion of days 
covered over 1 year. Persistence was defined as prescription renewal within 90 
days of the previous prescription and was plotted using Kaplan-Meier curves over 
5 years. The 5-year hazard and cumulative incidence of initiating a subsequent 
episode were estimated with survival analyses. We compared adherence and 
persistence between the treatment episodes using t and log-rank tests.
RESULTS: The cohort included 113 435 COPD patients. Adherence and persistence to 
LAAC were significantly lower in the subsequent treatment episode (55% vs 63%; P 
< 0.0001). The likelihood of initiating a subsequent episode was greatest 
immediately after the cessation of the initial episode, with 59% of patients 
starting a subsequent episode within 1 year.
CONCLUSION: Adherence and persistence to LAAC were lower in the subsequent 
treatment episode. Interventions should be offered quickly after LAAC cessation.

BACKGROUND: Long-acting bronchodilators are the cornerstone of pharmacologic 
treatment of COPD. The new combination of long-acting muscarinic antagonist 
(LAMA) tiotropium (TIO) and long acting beta-agonists (LABA) olodaterol (OLO) 
has been introduced as fist line therapy for COPD. This article analyses the 
evidence of efficacy and safety of the TIO/OLO combination.
METHODS: A systematic review and metaanalysis of randomized controlled trials 
(RCT) with a period of treatment of at least 6 weeks, in patients with COPD 
confirmed by spirometry, comparing combined treatment with TIO/OLO (approved 
doses only), with any of the mono-components or any other active comparator 
administered as an inhalator.
RESULTS: A total of 10 Randomized controlled trials (RCT) were identified 
(N = 10,918). TIO/OLO significantly improved trough FEV1 from baseline to week 
12 versus TIO, OLO and LABA/ICS (0.06 L, 0.09 L and between 0.04 and 0.05 L, 
respectively). TIO/OLO improved transitional dyspnea index (TDI) and St. 
George's Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ) compared with mono-components, with 
patients more likely to achieve clinically important improvements in TDI (risk 
ratio [RR]: 1.17, 95% confidence interval [CI]: [1.07, 1.28] versus TIO and RR: 
1.14, 95%CI: [1.01, 1.28] versus OLO) and in SGRQ (RR: 1.21, 95%CI: [1.12, 1.30] 
versus TIO and RR: 1.28, 95%CI: [1.18, 1.40] versus OLO). Patients treated with 
TIO/OLO showed a significant reduction in the use of rescue medication and no 
significant differences in frequency of general and serious adverse events were 
observed between TIO/OLO and mono-components.
CONCLUSIONS: Treatment with TIO/OLO provided significant improvements in lung 
function versus mono-components and LABA/ICS with more patients achieving 
significant improvements in dyspnea and health status. No differences in adverse 
events were observed compared with other active treatments.

Acetylcholine binds to muscarinic receptors to play a key role in the 
pathophysiology of asthma, leading to bronchoconstriction, increased mucus 
secretion, inflammation and airway remodelling. Anticholinergics are muscarinic 
receptor antagonists that are used in the treatment of chronic obstructive 
pulmonary disease and asthma. Recent in vivo and in vitro data have increased 
our understanding of how acetylcholine contributes to the disease manifestations 
of asthma, as well as elucidating the mechanism of action of anticholinergics. 
This review assesses the latest literature on acetylcholine in asthma 
pathophysiology, with a closer look at its role in airway inflammation and 
remodelling. New insights into the mechanism of action of anticholinergics, 
their effects on airway remodelling, and a review of the efficacy and safety of 
long acting anticholinergics in asthma treatment will also be covered, including 
a summary of the latest clinical trial data.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: While several studies have found that prescribing 
practices do not conform to chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) 
treatment guidelines, none have examined longitudinal patterns of use of 
long-acting beta2 -agonist (LABA) and long-acting muscarinic antagonist (LAMA) 
therapy across an entire country. We undertook a nationwide follow-up study to 
describe treatment patterns in new users of long-acting bronchodilators.
METHODS: National health and pharmaceutical dispensing data were used to 
identify patients aged ≥45 years who initiated LABA and/or LAMA therapy for COPD 
between 1 February 2006 and 31 December 2013. Dispensings of LABAs, LAMAs and 
inhaled corticosteroids (ICSs) were aggregated into episodes of use of 
therapeutic regimens. Kaplan-Meier curves, sunburst plots and sequence index 
plots were generated to summarize, respectively, the duration of the first 
regimen, the sequences in which unique regimens were used and the patterns of 
use and non-use during follow-up.
RESULTS: The study cohort included 83 435 patients with 290 400 person-years of 
follow-up. The most commonly initiated regimen was a LABA with an ICS. ICS use 
was inconsistent with international guidelines: over- and under-treatment 
occurred in patients with infrequent and frequent exacerbations, respectively, 
and ICS monotherapy was common. The median duration of the first regimen was 
46 days. Many patients used multiple regimens over time and periods of non-use 
were common.
CONCLUSION: In this nationwide study, patterns of use of LABAs, LAMAs and ICSs 
were complex and often did not comply with treatment guidelines. Further work is 
required to address the discrepancy between guidelines and prescribing 
practices.

PURPOSE: There is currently no measure to predict a treatability of long-acting 
β-2 agonist (LABA) or long-acting muscarinic antagonist (LAMA) in patients with 
chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). We aimed to build prediction 
models for the treatment response to these bronchodilators, in order to 
determine the most responsive medication for patients with COPD.
METHODS: We performed a prospective open-label crossover study, in which each 
long-acting bronchodilator was given in a random order to 65 patients with 
stable COPD for 4 weeks, with a 4-week washout period in between. We analyzed 14 
baseline clinical traits, expression profiles of 31,426 gene transcripts, and 
damaged-gene scores of 6,464 genes acquired from leukocytes. The gene expression 
profiles were measured by RNA microarray and the damaged-gene scores were 
obtained after DNA exome sequencing. Linear regression analyses were performed 
to build prediction models after using factor and correlation analyses.
RESULTS: Using a prediction model for a LABA, traits found associated with the 
treatment response were post-bronchodilator forced expiratory volume in 1 
second, bronchodilator reversibility (BDR) to salbutamol, expression of three 
genes (CLN8, PCSK5, and SKP2), and damage scores of four genes (EPG5, FNBP4, 
SCN10A, and SPTBN5) (R2=0.512, p<0.001). Traits associated with the treatment 
response to a LAMA were COPD assessment test score, BDR, expression of four 
genes (C1orf115, KIAA1618, PRKX, and RHOQ) and damage scores of three genes 
(FBN3, FDFT1, and ZBED6) (R2=0.575, p<0.001). The prediction models consisting 
only of clinical traits appeared too weak to predict the treatment response, 
with R2=0.231 for the LABA model and R2=0.121 for the LAMA model.
CONCLUSION: Adding the expressions of genes and damaged-gene scores to the 
clinical traits may improve the predictability of treatment response to 
long-acting bronchodilators.

The purpose of this study was to systematically review the efficacy and safety 
of long-acting β-agonist/long-acting muscarinic antagonist (LABA/LAMA) and 
LABA/inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) combinations in patients with advanced chronic 
obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Randomized clinical trials of at least 
12 weeks of duration comparing LABA/LAMA and LABA/ICS combinations were 
included. We chose forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1), St. George's 
Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ) score, Transitional Dyspnea Index (TDI), COPD 
Assessment Test (CAT) score, COPD exacerbations, mortality, and other safety 
parameters as outcome assessment criteria. We included six randomized controlled 
trials with a total of 4,319 patients. Most patients did not have a history of 
exacerbation. LABA/LAMA was associated with greater improvement in FEV1 than 
LABA/ICS (mean difference (MD) 0.09L, 95%confidence interval (CI) 0.07 to 0.11L; 
high certainty). Two treatments appeared clinically equivalent in improving SGRQ 
(MD -0.12, 95%CI -1.16 to 0.92; high certainty), TDI (MD 0.15, 95%CI -0.05 to 
0.35; high certainty), and CAT scores (MD 0.28 95%CI -0.29 to 0.85; moderate 
certainty). LABA/LAMA was associated with an absolute reduction of approximately 
8% in the incidence of pneumonia compared with LABA/ICS (risk ratio 0.41, 95%CI 
0.18 to 0.94; moderate certainty). There was no significant difference in safety 
and exacerbation outcomes. However, equivalence of two treatments could not be 
concluded due to imprecision especially for mortality, cardiac serious adverse 
events, and severe exacerbations. Our findings support the use of dual 
long-acting bronchodilators for patients with advanced COPD but without frequent 
exacerbations given the excess risk of pneumonia with LABA/ICS.

Comparative efficacy of long-acting muscarinic antagonists in preventing COPD 
exacerbations: a network meta-analysis and meta-regression.

Oba Y, Lone NA.

BACKGROUND: We hypothesized a class effect of currently available long-acting 
muscarinic antagonists (LAMAs; i.e., tiotropium as a dry powder inhaler or a 
soft mist inhaler, aclidinium bromide, and glycopyrronium) in preventing chronic 
obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) exacerbations. The hypothesis was tested 
with a network meta-analysis.
METHODS: Several databases and manufacturer’s websites were searched for 
relevant clinical trials. Randomized, controlled trials, of at least 12 weeks 
duration, comparing a LAMA with placebo or another LAMA were included. 
Moderate-to-severe and severe exacerbations were chosen as the outcome 
assessment criteria. The data were pooled using network meta-analysis.
RESULTS: A total of 27 studies with 48,140 subjects were included. All LAMAs 
reduced moderate-to-severe exacerbations compared with placebo. However, there 
were no statistically significant differences in preventing moderate-to-severe 
or severe exacerbations among LABAs. In a subgroup analysis restricting studies 
to those that had a minimum of 6 months of treatment, glycopyrronium was 
associated with the least-effective strategy and aclidinium was associated with 
the greatest probability of being the best therapy in preventing severe 
exacerbations. Our meta-regression analysis suggested that the prevention of 
COPD exacerbations were less effective in studies which allowed concomitant use 
of a long-acting beta agonist (LABA).
CONCLUSION: All LAMAs were equally effective in preventing moderate-to-severe 
exacerbations. Aclidinium was associated with the lowest risk for severe 
exacerbations when treatment duration was 6 months or longer. The concomitant 
use of LABA may not enhance the efficacy of LAMAs in preventing COPD 
exacerbations. More studies are needed to further examine above findings.

Long acting muscarinic antagonists (LAMA) are currently considered the 
therapeutic mainstay for patients with COPD and have been shown to improve 
clinical outcomes including symptoms, exercise capacity and airflow limitation. 
Irisin, is a newly discovered hormone-like myokine generated by skeletal muscle 
cells in response to exercise and it is suggested to regulate energy expenditure 
and exercise capacity. The aim of the present study was to investigate if 
treatment with LAMA alters serum irisin levels in patients with COPD. Irisin was 
assessed by ELISA in the serum of 506 patients with COPD, GOLD II-IV, with a 
smoking history >10 PY, who were included in the PROMISE-COPD cohort. The effect 
of inhaled LAMA on serum irisin levels was evaluated in a proof-of-concept 
cohort of 40 COPD patients. Univariate linear regression analysis revealed that 
there was a significant negative association of irisin with age-adjusted 
Charlson score (p = 0.003) and a positive association of irisin with 6-min 
walking distance (6MWD) (p = 0.018) and treatment with LAMA (p = 0.004) but not 
with LABA or ICS. Multivariate analysis revealed that the association of irisin 
with LAMA treatment remains significant after adjustment for age-adjusted score 
and 6MWD. In the proof-of-concept cohort a single inhalation of LAMA stimulated 
serum irisin levels after 4 h. These findings imply that treatment of COPD 
patients with LAMA increase circulating irisin, thus explaining some of the 
beneficial extra-pulmonary effects of these drugs when used in the treatment of 
COPD.

the finnish guidelines.

The Finnish Medical Society Duodecim initiated and managed the update of the 
Finnish national guideline for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). The 
Finnish COPD guideline was revised to acknowledge the progress in diagnosis and 
management of COPD. This Finnish COPD guideline in English language is a part of 
the original guideline and focuses on the diagnosis, assessment and 
pharmacotherapy of stable COPD. It is intended to be used mainly in primary 
health care but not forgetting respiratory specialists and other healthcare 
workers. The new recommendations and statements are based on the best evidence 
available from the medical literature, other published national guidelines and 
the GOLD (Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease) report. This 
guideline introduces the diagnostic approach, differential diagnostics towards 
asthma, assessment and treatment strategy to control symptoms and to prevent 
exacerbations. The pharmacotherapy is based on the symptoms and a clinical 
phenotype of the individual patient. The guideline defines three clinically 
relevant phenotypes including the low and high exacerbation risk phenotypes and 
the neglected asthma-COPD overlap syndrome (ACOS). These clinical phenotypes can 
help clinicians to identify patients that respond to specific pharmacological 
interventions. For the low exacerbation risk phenotype, pharmacotherapy with 
short-acting β2 -agonists (salbutamol, terbutaline) or anticholinergics 
(ipratropium) or their combination (fenoterol-ipratropium) is recommended in 
patients with less symptoms. If short-acting bronchodilators are not enough to 
control symptoms, a long-acting β2 -agonist (formoterol, indacaterol, olodaterol 
or salmeterol) or a long acting anticholinergic (muscarinic receptor 
antagonists; aclidinium, glycopyrronium, tiotropium, umeclidinium) or their 
combination is recommended. For the high exacerbation risk phenotype, 
pharmacotherapy with a long acting anticholinergic or a fixed combination of an 
inhaled glucocorticoid and a long-acting β2 -agonist (budesonide-formoterol, 
beclomethasone dipropionate-formoterol, fluticasone propionate-salmeterol or 
fluticasone furoate-vilanterol) is recommended as a first choice. Other 
treatment options for this phenotype include combination of long-acting 
bronchodilators given from separate inhalers or as a fixed combination 
(glycopyrronium-indacaterol or umeclidinium-vilanterol) or a triple combination 
of an inhaled glucocorticoid, a long-acting β2 -agonist and a long-acting 
anticholinergic. If the patient has severe-to-very severe COPD (FEV1  < 50% 
predicted), chronic bronchitis and frequent exacerbations despite long-acting 
bronchodilators, the pharmacotherapy may include also roflumilast. ACOS is a 
phenotype of COPD in which there are features that comply with both asthma and 
COPD. Patients belonging to this phenotype have usually been excluded from 
studies evaluating the effects of drugs both in asthma and in COPD. Thus, 
evidence-based recommendation of treatment cannot be given. The treatment should 
cover both diseases. Generally, the therapy should include at least inhaled 
glucocorticoids (beclomethasone dipropionate, budesonide, ciclesonide, 
fluticasone furoate, fluticasone propionate or mometasone) combined with a 
long-acting bronchodilator (β2 -agonist or anticholinergic or both).

This randomized, double-blind, crossover study examined the physiological 
rationale for using a dual long-acting bronchodilator (umeclidinium/vilanterol 
(UME/VIL)) versus its muscarinic-antagonist component (UME) as treatment for 
dyspnea and exercise intolerance in moderate COPD. After each 4-week treatment 
period, subjects performed pulmonary function and symptom-limited constant-work 
rate cycling tests with diaphragm electromyogram (EMGdi), esophageal (Pes), 
gastric (Pga) and transdiaphragmatic (Pdi) pressure measurements. Fourteen 
subjects completed the study. Both treatments improved spirometry and airway 
resistance. UME/VIL had larger increases in FEV1 (+0.14±0.23L, p<0.05) but no 
added reduction in lung hyperinflation compared with UME. Isotime during 
exercise after UME/VIL versus UME (p<0.05): "unpleasantness of breathing" fell 
0.8±1.3 Borg units; mean expiratory flow and ventilation increased; Pdi and Pga 
decreased. There were no treatment differences in endurance time, breathing 
pattern, operating lung volumes, inspiratory neural drive (EMGdi) or respiratory 
muscle effort (Pes swings) during exercise. UME/VIL compared with UME was 
associated with reduced breathing unpleasantness reflecting improved airway and 
respiratory muscle function during exercise.

PURPOSE: Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and asthma are leading 
causes of morbidity and mortality. This narrative review provides an appraisal 
of the pharmacological and clinical characteristics of tiotropium in COPD and 
asthma, and examines how these compare with other long-acting bronchodilators. 
The evidence base is placed into context by relating it to factors affecting 
clinicians' choice of therapy.
MAIN FINDINGS: Desirable attributes of a long-acting muscarinic antagonist 
(LAMA) maintenance therapy include effective pharmacological bronchodilation, 
improved lung function, exacerbation efficacy, and positive effects on symptom 
control, exercise capacity and quality of life across a broad patient 
population. Tolerability and convenience of use are also important for patient 
well-being and treatment adherence. Tiotropium shows higher affinity for 
muscarinic receptors than ipratropium, and prolonged binding to the M3 receptor 
compared with other LAMAs. In COPD, tiotropium has demonstrated improved lung 
function and exacerbation prevention compared with placebo or long-acting 
β2-agonists, similar exacerbation efficacy to other LAMAs, and enhanced symptom 
control and health status versus placebo. UniTinA-asthma® showed the benefits of 
add-on tiotropium in patients with uncontrolled mild to moderate and severe 
asthma. Tiotropium is well tolerated, with an incidence of adverse events 
similar to placebo, except for known infrequent side effects of 
anticholinergics. Tiotropium HandiHaler® and Respimat® augment inhaler choice in 
COPD.
PRINCIPAL CONCLUSIONS: With over 10 years' prescribing history and 50 million 
patient-years of use, tiotropium has the benefit of a more extensive clinical 
evidence base than other long-acting bronchodilators, with demonstrated efficacy 
and safety in COPD and symptomatic asthma.

Medicine, Yokohama, Japan.

CLINICAL QUESTION: Are inhaled long-acting muscarinic antagonists (LAMA) 
combined with long-acting β-agonists (LABA) associated with differences in the 
incidence of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) exacerbation and 
serious adverse events and with differences in quality of life and forced 
expiratory volume in the first second of expiration (FEV1) vs inhaled LABA plus 
inhaled corticosteroids therapy for the treatment of stable COPD?
BOTTOM LINE: Compared with inhaled LABA combined with corticosteroids, inhaled 
LAMA combined with LABA may be associated with a lower risk of COPD exacerbation 
and with greater improvement in FEV1 without differences in the incidence of 
serious severe adverse events or quality of life.

The role of the anti-inflammatory and bronchodilator triple therapy, including a 
long acting ß2-agonist (LABA), a long-acting muscarinic antagonist (LAMA) and an 
inhaled corticosteroid (ICS), in the prevention of the exacerbations of chronic 
obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is still not clearly established, and 
requires comparison with dual therapy (LABA-CSI or LABA-LAMA). IMPACT is a phase 
3, double-blind randomized study comparing the tritherapy (LABA-LAMA-ICS) in a 
single inhaler (vilanterol 25 ?g/umeclidinium 62.5 ?g/fluticasone furoate 100 
?g) with the LABA-ICS association (vilanterol 25 ?g-fluticasone furoate 100 ?g) 
and the combination LABA-LAMA (vilanterol 25 ?g/umeclidinium 62.5 ?g) on the 
reduction of the rate of exacerbation as the primary outcome, but also on the 
pulmonary function, the quality of life, the dyspnea and the mortality.Triple 
therapy by comparison with dual therapy (LABA-ICS or LABA-LAMA) improves 
numerous parameters such as the rate of moderate to severe exacerbations, the 
symptoms, the respiratory function, the quality of life, while being well 
tolerated. Finally, the IMPACT study gives an "evidence base" for the GOLD 
guidelines proposing triple therapy in symptomatic COPD patients presenting 
exacerbations despite dual therapy.

INTRODUCTION: The treatment of COPD (Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease) aims 
to improve the patients's well-being and to reduce mortality, morbidity and the 
development of exacerbations. This study was thus designed to compare the 
efficacy and tolerability of salmeterol/fluticasone combination with tiotropium 
in patients with moderate COPD.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: This was an open, prospective, randomized trial in COPD 
patients whose FEV1 (forced expiratory volume in 1 second) levels were between 
80% and 50% predicted. A total of 44 patients who met the inclusion and exlusion 
criteria and who gave written informed consent were included in the study. At 
the end of the two week wash-out period, the patients were randomized to receive 
either salmeterol 50 µg/fluticasone 500 µg combination as dry powder inhaler 
twice daily (SF Group) or tiotropium dry powder inhaler 18 µg once daily (T 
Group) for one year. These were equally distributed in the two groups (22 
patients in each study group). At follow-up, the patients were required to come 
to the outpatient clinic at the third, sixth, ninth and twelfth months.
RESULT: There were no statistically significant difference between the two 
groups with regards to demographic features and baseline measurements. There 
were 1.2 ± 1.7 exacerbations in SF Group and 2.1 ± 2.2 exacerbations in T Group 
(p= 0.070). The time to the first exacerbation was 4.2 ± 4.0 and 4.2 ± 3.3 
months, respectively (p= 0.697). The number of severe exacerbations that 
resulted in admission to the emergency department or hospital was 0.6 ± 1.0 and 
1.1 ± 1.4, respectively (p= 0.245). Significant improvements were observed in 
CAT (CPOD Assessment Test) scores in both groups during the treatment period (p< 
0.0001); but there was no difference between the two groups.
CONCLUSIONS: This study has shown that in patients with moderate COPD, treatment 
with combined corticosteroid and long-acting beta-2 agonist provides similar 
improvements in pulmonary function tests, patient-reported outcomes and exercise 
capacity as compared a long acting anticholinergics.

COPD is characterized by persistent airflow limitation, progressive 
breathlessness, cough, and sputum production. Long-acting muscarinic antagonists 
(LAMAs) are one of the recommended first-choice therapeutic options for patients 
with COPD, and several new agents have been developed in recent years. A 
literature search identified 14 published randomized, placebo-controlled studies 
of the efficacy and safety of LAMAs in patients with COPD, with improvements 
seen in lung function, exacerbations, breathlessness, and health status. A 
greater weight of evidence currently exists for glycopyrronium (GLY) and 
tiotropium than for umeclidinium and aclidinium, especially in terms of 
exacerbation reductions. To date, there have been few head-to-head clinical 
studies of the different LAMAs. Available data indicate that GLY and aclidinium 
have similar efficacy to tiotropium in terms of improving lung function, 
dyspnea, exacerbations, and health status. Overall, evidence demonstrates that 
currently available LAMAs provide effective and generally well-tolerated therapy 
for patients with COPD. Delivery devices for the different LAMAs vary, which may 
affect individual patient's adherence to and preference for treatment. Subtle 
differences between individual therapeutic options may be important to 
individual patients and the final treatment choice should involve physician's 
and patient's experiences and preferences.

The inclusion of an asthma/chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) overlap 
syndrome (ACOS) population in the 2015 Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive 
Lung Disease strategic documents has raised questions about the profile of these 
patients in clinical practice, as they are mostly excluded from asthma and COPD 
clinical trials. We estimated the disease burden, co-morbidities, and 
respiratory treatments of patients with asthma/COPD overlap, utilizing the 
Truven MarketScan commercial and Medicare databases. Patients with ≥1 COPD or 
chronic obstructive asthma diagnostic code were identified between January 1, 
2008, and December 31, 2011. The asthma/COPD overlap group was defined and 
stratified based upon type and frequency of asthma diagnostic code (chronic 
obstructive asthma only, COPD and chronic obstructive asthma, and COPD and ≥1 
asthma code). 1,488,613 patients were identified; of these, 1,171,626 were 
diagnosed with COPD alone and 316,987 with asthma/COPD overlap. Patients with 
asthma and COPD had higher disease burden indicators and inhaled 
corticosteroid/long-acting beta-agonist use compared with COPD alone. This trend 
was consistent for all definitions of asthma/COPD overlap. Patients with 
obstructive asthma and COPD tended to be older, with greater disease burden 
compared with other definitions; this population may represent a more severe 
form of asthma/COPD overlap. Disease burden and treatment also varied based on 
the codes defining asthma/COPD overlap, indicating possible phenotypic 
differences. More clinical insight and detailed phenotyping is needed to 
determine the reasons for coding variation in asthma/COPD overlap, with 
implications for further research to address unmet needs.

BACKGROUND: Ideally, treatment recommendations for maintenance therapy-naïve 
patients with COPD should be based on studies conducted specifically in this 
population. We have reviewed evidence from previous studies of pharmacological 
treatments in maintenance therapy-naïve patients with COPD and performed a new 
post-hoc analysis of dual bronchodilator treatment in this population, aiming to 
assess the effectiveness of these interventions.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: A literature review identified clinical trials that 
included analyses of patients with COPD who were maintenance therapy-naïve with 
long-acting β2-agonists (LABA) or long-acting muscarinic antagonists (LAMA). 
Additionally, a post-hoc subgroup analysis was conducted for maintenance 
therapy-naïve patients with COPD in two large phase III, randomized, 
double-blind, 24-week trials investigating the efficacy of aclidinium 
bromide/formoterol fumarate (AB/FF) fixed-dose combination versus monotherapy or 
placebo (ACLIFORM [NCT01462942] and AUGMENT [NCT01437397]).
RESULTS: Treatment-naïve patients with COPD often represent a population of 
patients at the earliest stage at which most patients seek treatment. Of nine 
relevant studies identified, all reported positive findings for efficacy of 
LABA, LAMA, or LABA/LAMA treatment in maintenance therapy-naïve populations. 
Improvements were observed in lung function, symptoms, and health status versus 
monotherapy or placebo. Post-hoc analysis of ACLIFORM and AUGMENT demonstrated 
that AB/FF was effective in improving lung function in patients who had received 
no prior maintenance therapy. AB/FF showed improvements in 1 hr post-dose FEV1, 
trough FEV1, and patient-reported outcomes versus placebo and monotherapies. 
Combined with reviews of previous studies in maintenance therapy-naïve patients, 
these findings suggest that earlier intervention with a dual bronchodilator 
maintenance therapy, such as AB/FF, may provide significantly greater benefits 
than LAMA or LABA mono-bronchodilator therapy as a first maintenance treatment 
for COPD.
CONCLUSION: These data show that therapeutic intervention is effective in 
treatment-naïve patients. Intervention with dual bronchodilator therapy as a 
first maintenance treatment for COPD may provide greater benefits than LAMA or 
LABA monotherapy.

Long acting muscarinic receptor antagonists (LAMA) reverse airflow obstruction 
by antagonizing para-sympathetic bronchoconstricting effects within the airways. 
For years, tiotropium, has been the cornerstone LAMA for chronic obstructive 
pulmonary disease (COPD) management. Recently, new agents, aclidinium bromide, 
glycopyrronium bromide, and umeclidinium bromide, have been developed and 
introduced into clinical practice. Areas covered: This article reviews the 
clinical efficacy and adverse effects of currently available LAMAs in COPD 
treatment as well as developing LAMAs in early clinical trials and preclinical 
studies (V0162, TD-4208, CHF 5407, AZD9164, AZD8683, bencycloquidium). In 
addition, a new class of molecule that combines muscarinic antagonist and 
β2-adrenergic properties (MABA) is described and current developmental progress 
discussed (GSK-961081, THRX-200495). Expert opinion: Future key areas for 
developing drugs for the management of COPD include prolonged duration of 
action, optimal delivery systems, synergistic combinations with other drugs, 
maximization of benefits and minimization of adverse effects. The development of 
new LAMA and MABA molecules provides exciting progress towards simpler and more 
effective COPD management.

We quantified TGF-β1 and acetylcholine (ACh) concentrations in induced sputum 
supernatants (ISSs) from 18 healthy controls (HC), 22 healthy smokers (HS) and 
21 COPDs. ISSs from HC, HS and COPD as well as rhTGF-β1 were also tested in 
neutrophil adhesion and in mAChR2, mAChR3 and ChAT expression experiments in 
human bronchial epithelial cells (16-HBE). Finally, we evaluated the effects of 
Olodaterol (a novel inhaled β(2)-adrenoceptor agonist) and Tiotropium Spiriva®, 
alone or in combination, on neutrophil adhesion and mAChRs and ChAT expression 
in stimulated 16-HBE. The results showed that 1) TGF-β1 and ACh concentrations 
are increased in ISSs from COPD in comparison to HC and HS, and TGF-β1 in HS is 
higher than in HC; 2) ISSs from COPD and HS caused increased neutrophil adhesion 
to 16-HBE when compared to ISSs from HC. The effect of ISSs from COPD was 
significantly reduced by TGF-β1 depletion or by the pretreatment with Olodaterol 
or Tiotropium alone or in combination, while the effect of ISSs from HS was 
significantly reduced by the pretreatment with Olodaterol alone; 3) mAChR2, 
mAChR3 and ChAT expression was increased in 16-HBE stimulated with ISSs from 
COPD and TGF-β1 depletion significantly reduced this effect on mAChR3 and ChAT 
expression; 4) rhTGF-β1 increased mAChR2, mAChR3 and ChAT expression in 16-HBE; 
5) Olodaterol did not affect the expression of mAChRs and ChAT in 16-HBE. Our 
findings support the use of β₂ long-acting and anticholinergic drugs to control 
the bronchoconstriction and TGF-β1-mediated neutrophilic inflammation in COPD.

PURPOSE: Inappropriate use of an inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) for COPD has 
clinical and economic disadvantages. This retrospective analysis of The UK 
Health Improvement Network (THIN) database identified factors influencing 
treatment escalation (step-up) from a long-acting muscarinic antagonist (LAMA) 
to triple therapy (LAMA + long-acting β-agonist-ICS). Secondary objectives 
included time to step up from first LAMA prescription, Global Initiative for 
Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) grouping (2011/2013, 2017), and Medical 
Research Council (MRC) grade prior to treatment escalation.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Data were included from 14,866 people ≥35 years old with 
a COPD diagnosis (June 1, 2010-May 10, 2015) and initiated on LAMA monotherapy. 
The most commonly used LAMA at baseline was tiotropium (92%).
RESULTS: Multivariate analysis (10,492 patients) revealed that COPD 
exacerbations, lower forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1), "asthma", MRC 
grade, proactive and reactive COPD primary care, elective secondary-care 
contact, cough, and number of short-acting bronchodilator prescriptions were 
positively associated with treatment escalation (P<0.05). Being older, a 
current/ex-smoker, or having increased sputum symptom codes were negatively 
associated with treatment escalation (P<0.05). Median MRC score was 2 at 
baseline and 3 prior to treatment escalation. Using the last MRC reading and 
exacerbation history in the year prior to escalation, GOLD 2017 groupings were A 
27.4%, B 37.3%, C 15.3%, and D 20%. In patients with available FEV1 measures, 
exacerbations, and MRC code (n=1,064), GOLD 2011/2013 groupings were A 20.4%, B 
19.2%, C 24.8%, and D 35.6%.
CONCLUSION: While the presence of COPD exacerbations seems to be the main driver 
for treatment escalation, according to the 2017 GOLD strategy many patients 
appear to be overtreated, as they would not be recommended for treatment 
escalation. Reviewing patients' treatment in the light of the new GOLD strategy 
has the potential to reduce inappropriate use of triple therapy.

BACKGROUND: To assess the symptomatic and cost burden among patients initiating 
long-acting bronchodilator (LABD) therapy and impact of adherence on healthcare 
resource use and costs.
METHODS: This retrospective cohort study identified patients with COPD who were 
newly prescribed a LABD (long-acting muscarinic antagonist [LAMA], long-acting 
beta2-agonist [LABA], a combination of LABA+LAMA or combination of LABA with 
inhaled corticosteroid [ICS]/LABA) between January 1, 2009 and November 30, 2013 
from the UK Clinical Practice Research Datalink. Health care resource use, costs 
and symptom burden up to 24 months after treatment initiation were estimated. 
Adherence in the follow-up period was assessed using the medication possession 
ratio (MPR ≥ 80%).
RESULTS: The cohort comprised 8283 LABD initiators (16% LABA, 81% LAMA and 3% 
LABA+LAMA) and 9246 LABA+ICS initiators with generally similar baseline 
characteristics; prior exacerbation rate was higher in the LABA+ICS cohort. Less 
than half the patients (LAMA:42%; LABA:34% and LABA+ICS:34%) were adherent to 
their index medication. Among adherent patients, the total annual per patient 
cost of COPD was £3008 for LAMA initiators, £2783 for LABA initiators and £3376 
for LABA+ICS initiators; primarily due to general practitioner interactions. 
Among patients with a Medical Research Council dyspnea score recorded during 24 
months follow-up, a substantial proportion of adherent patients (LAMA: 41%; 
LABA: 45%; LABA+ICS 44%) had clinically significant dyspnoea (MRC ≥ 3).
CONCLUSION: Cost and symptomatic burden of COPD was high among patients 
initiating maintenance treatment, including patients adherent with their initial 
treatment. General practitioner interactions were the primary driver of costs. 
Further, real world studies are required to address unmet needs and optimize 
treatment pathways to improve COPD symptom burden and outcomes.

Inhaled bronchodilators - such as long-acting muscarinic receptor antagonists 
(LAMAs) - are central to the pharmacological management of symptomatic chronic 
obstructive pulmonary disease. LAMAs are considered to be safe drugs at 
recommended dosages. In the present issue of the Journal safety of umeclidinium, 
a recently marketed LAMA, at twice the recommended dosage, has been evaluated 
with good results in a Japanese, COPD population. However, because muscarinic 
receptors are expressed not only in the lungs but also at the level of heart, 
digestive and urinary apparatus, the potential exists for LAMAs to cause adverse 
events related to stimulation of receptors in these organs. Head-to-head and 
post-marketing vigilance studies are required to determine the profile risk of 
these drugs, ultimately, and whether differences exist between currently 
available LAMAs.

BACKGROUND: Real-world prescription pathways leading to triple therapy (TT) 
(inhaled corticosteroid [ICS] plus long-acting β2-agonist bronchodilator [LABA] 
plus long-acting muscarinic antagonist) differ from Global initiative for 
chronic Obstructive Lung Disease [GOLD] and National Institute for Health and 
Care Excellence treatment recommendations. This study sets out to identify COPD 
patients without asthma receiving TT, and determine the pathways taken from 
diagnosis to the first prescription of TT.
METHODS: This was a historical analysis of COPD patients without asthma from the 
Optimum Patient Care Research Database (387 primary-care practices across the 
UK) from 2002 to 2010. Patient disease severity was classified using GOLD 2013 
criteria. Data were analyzed to determine prescribing of TT before, at, and 
after COPD diagnosis; the average time taken to receive TT; and the impact of 
lung function grade, modified Medical Research Council dyspnea score, and 
exacerbation history on the pathway to TT.
RESULTS: During the study period, 32% of patients received TT. Of these, 19%, 
28%, 37%, and 46% of patients classified as GOLD A, B, C, and D, respectively, 
progressed to TT after diagnosis (P<0.001). Of all patients prescribed TT, 25% 
were prescribed TT within 1 year of diagnosis, irrespective of GOLD 
classification (P=0.065). The most common prescription pathway to TT was LABA 
plus ICS. It was observed that exacerbation history did influence the pathway of 
LABA plus ICS to TT.
CONCLUSION: Real life UK prescription data demonstrates the inappropriate 
prescribing of TT and confirms that starting patients on ICS plus LABA results 
in the inevitable drift to overuse of TT. This study highlights the need for 
dissemination and implementation of COPD guidelines to physicians, ensuring that 
patients receive the recommended therapy.

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a major cause of death and 
disability worldwide. Inhaled bronchodilators are the mainstay of COPD 
pharmacological treatment. Long-acting muscarinic antagonists (LAMAs) are a 
major class of inhaled bronchodilators. Some LAMA/device systems with different 
characteristics and dosing schedules are currently approved for maintenance 
therapy of COPD and a range of other products are being developed. They improve 
lung function and patient-reported outcomes and reduce acute bronchial 
exacerbations with good safety. LAMAs are used either alone or associated with 
long-acting β₂-agonists, eventually in fixed dose combinations. Long-acting 
β₂-agonist/LAMA combinations assure additional benefits over the individual 
components alone. The reader will obtain a view of the safety and efficacy of 
the different LAMA/device systems in COPD patients.

OBJECTIVE: Long-acting β2-agonists (LABAs) and long-acting muscarinic 
antagonists (LAMAs) are burdened by the potential risk of inducing 
cardiovascular serious adverse events (SAEs) in COPD patients. Since the risk of 
combining a LABA with a LAMA could be greater, we have carried out a 
quantitative synthesis to investigate the cardiovascular safety profile of 
LABA/LAMA fixed-dose combinations (FDCs).
METHODS: A pair-wise and network meta-analysis was performed by using the data 
of the repository database ClinicalTrials.gov concerning the impact of approved 
LABA/LAMA FDCs versus monocomponents and/or placebo on cardiovascular SAEs in 
COPD.
RESULTS: Overall, LABA/LAMA FDCs did not significantly (P>0.05) modulate the 
risk of cardiovascular SAEs versus monocomponents. However, the network 
meta-analysis indicated that aclidinium/formoterol 400/12 µg and 
tiotropium/olodaterol 5/5 µg were the safest FDCs, followed by 
umeclidinium/vilanterol 62.5/25 µg which was as safe as placebo, whereas 
glycopyrronium/formoterol 14.9/9.6, glycopyrronium/indacaterol 15.6/27.5 µg, and 
glycopyrronium/indacaterol 50/110 µg were the least safe FDCs. No impact on 
mortality was detected for each specific FDC.
CONCLUSION: This meta-analysis indicates that LABA/LAMA FDC therapy is 
characterized by an excellent cardiovascular safety profile in COPD patients. 
However, the findings of this quantitative synthesis have been obtained from 
populations that participated in randomized clinical trials, and were devoid of 
major cardiovascular diseases. Thus, post-marketing surveillance and 
observational studies may help to better define the real impact of specific FDCs 
with regard to the cardiovascular risk.

Maintenance bronchodilator therapy with long-acting β-agonists (LABAs) and 
long-acting muscarinic antagonists (LAMAs) is the cornerstone treatment for 
patients with stable chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Fixed-dose 
combinations (FDCs) of LABA/LAMA are recommended for the majority of symptomatic 
COPD patients by global guidelines; regional guidelines such as the Japanese and 
Korean guidelines also provide similar recommendations for the use of LABA/LAMA 
FDCs. This review comprehensively describes the latest clinical evidence from 
key studies on the efficacy and safety of four approved LABA/LAMA fixed-dose 
combinations: indacaterol/glycopyrronium, vilanterol/umeclidinium, 
formoterol/aclidinium, and olodaterol/tiotropium. Additionally, in this review 
we describe the rationale behind the use of LABA/LAMA FDC therapy, key findings 
from the preclinical and clinical trial evaluation of respective LABA and LAMA 
monocomponents, and the efficacy and safety of LABA/LAMA FDCs. Special emphasis 
is placed on the clinical evidence for the monocomponents and LABA/LAMA FDCs 
from the Asian population. This detailed overview of the efficacy and safety of 
LABA/LAMA FDCs in global and Asian COPD patients is envisaged to provide a 
better understanding of the benefits of these therapies and to inform healthcare 
providers and patients on their appropriate use.Funding: Novartis Pharma K.K.

Early impact of treatment with tiotropium, long acting anticholinergic 
preparation, in patients with COPD - real-life experience from an observational 
study.

Medicine, Warsaw, Poland.

BACKGROUND: Long-acting inhaled bronchodilators, including anticholinergic 
tiotropium, are recommended for the maintenance therapy of chronic obstructive 
pulmonary disease (COPD). It has been shown in a number of studies that 
treatment with tiotropium alleviates symptoms, improves exercise tolerance, 
health status, and reduces exacerbations in patients with moderate to very 
severe stage COPD.
AIM: The aim of this noninterventional study was to observe the early effects of 
the maintenance treatment with tiotropium in patients with COPD of different 
severities, who had been previously treated on a regular basis, or as required, 
with at least one short-acting bronchodilator, in a real-life setting in Poland. 
The effect of the treatment was assessed through the collection of COPD 
Assessment Test (CAT) data.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: The MATHS clinical study was an observational, 
noninterventional, open-label, prospective, uncontrolled, single-arm, 
postmarketing, surveillance, real-life study conducted with the involvement of 
236 pulmonology clinics based in Poland. The tiotropium observational period was 
3 months. The health and COPD status was measured with the CAT questionnaire. 
The primary efficacy endpoint was the mean change from the baseline in the total 
CAT score at the end of the 3-month observational period.
RESULTS: Patients treated with 18 μg of tiotropium once daily for 3 months 
showed a statistically significant result, with a clinically meaningful mean 
reduction (improvement) of 7.0 points in the total CAT score. The improvement 
was slightly greater in patients with more severe COPD; the mean change in the 
total CAT score was 7.6 in the subgroup of patients with more severe COPD and 
6.7 points in the subgroup of patients with moderate COPD.
CONCLUSION: Results of this real-life study provide further support for the use 
of tiotropium as a first-line maintenance treatment for patients with COPD of 
different severities in Poland.

OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to assess the current evidence for 
long-acting β2-agonist (LABA)/long-acting muscarinic antagonist (LAMA) 
fixed-dose combinations (FDCs) in the treatment of COPD.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: A systematic literature search of randomized controlled 
trials published in English up to September 2017 of LABA/LAMA FDCs vs LABA or 
LAMA or LABA/inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) FDCs in COPD patients was performed 
using PubMed, Embase, Scopus, and Google Scholar. Outcomes including forced 
expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1), Transition Dyspnea Index (TDI) scores, St 
George's Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ) scores, exacerbations, exercise 
tolerance (endurance time [ET]), inspiratory capacity (IC), and rescue 
medication use were evaluated.
RESULTS: In total, 27 studies were included in the review. LABA/LAMA FDCs 
significantly improved lung function (FEV1) at 12 weeks compared with LABA or 
LAMA or LABA/ICS. These effects were maintained over time. Significant 
improvements with LABA/LAMA FDCs vs each evaluated comparator were also observed 
in TDI and SGRQ scores, even if significant differences between different 
LABA/LAMA FDCs were detected. Only the LABA/LAMA FDC indacaterol/glycopyrronium 
has shown superiority vs LAMA and LABA/ICS for reducing exacerbation rates, 
while olodaterol/tiotropium and indacaterol/glycopyrronium have been shown to 
improve ET and IC vs the active comparators. Rescue medication use was 
significantly reduced by LABA/LAMA FDCs vs the evaluated comparators. LABA/LAMA 
FDCs were safe, with no increase in the risk of adverse events with LABA/LAMA 
FDCs vs the monocomponents.
CONCLUSION: Evidence supporting the efficacy of LABA/LAMA FDCs for COPD is 
heterogeneous, particularly for TDI and SGRQ scores, exacerbation rates, ET, and 
IC. So far, indacaterol/glycopyrronium is the LABA/LAMA FDC that has the 
strongest evidence for superiority vs LABA, LAMA, and LABA/ICS FDCs across the 
evaluated outcomes. LABA/LAMA FDCs were safe; however, more data should be 
collected in a real-world setting to confirm their safety.

OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to investigate whether perioperative inhalations of 
long-acting beta-agonists (LABAs) or long-acting muscarinic antagonists (LAMAs) 
might decrease the incidence of postoperative complications in lung cancer 
patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).
METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed 108 patients with COPD who underwent 
pulmonary resections for primary lung cancer at our hospital between January 
2013 and January 2016 to determine the association between the incidence of 
postoperative complications (e.g., prolonged air leakage and pneumonia) and the 
use of LABAs or LAMAs.
RESULTS: Thirty patients with COPD experienced postoperative complications 
(27.8%): Fourteen patients had prolonged air leakages (more than 7 days), ten 
patients developed pneumonia. The frequency of these postoperative pulmonary 
complications was significantly higher among the patients with COPD (24/108 
cases, 22.2%), compared with the frequency among non-COPD patients (15/224 
cases, 6.7%). Inhaled bronchodilators, such as LAMA or LABA, were prescribed for 
34 of the 108 patients with COPD; the remaining 74 patients were not treated 
with bronchodilators. Pulmonary complications were significant lower among the 
LAMA or LABA users (3/34 cases, 8.8%) than among the untreated COPD patients 
(21/74 cases, 28.4%).
CONCLUSION: For lung cancer patients with COPD, preoperative management using 
LABA or LAMA bronchodilators and smoking cessation can reduce the frequency of 
postoperative pulmonary complications after surgical lung resection. LAMA or 
LABA inhalation might be useful for not only perioperative care, but also for 
the long-term survival of COPD patients after surgery.

The role of tiotropium bromide, a long acting anticholinergic bronchodilator, in 
the management of COPD.

Bronchodilator therapy forms the mainstay of treatment for symptomatic patients 
with COPD. Long-acting bronchodilators, which maintain sustained airway patency 
over a 24-hour period, represent an advance in therapy. Tiotropium bromide is a 
new long-acting inhaled anticholinergic agent with superior pharmacodynamic 
properties compared with the short-acting anticholinergic, ipratropium bromide. 
Tiotropium bromide has been consistently shown to have a greater impact than 
ipratropium bromide on clinically important outcome measures such as health 
status. The mechanisms of clinical benefit with tiotropium bromide are 
multifactorial, but improved airway function, which enhances lung emptying and 
allows sustained deflation of over-inflated lungs, appears to explain 
improvements in dyspnea and exercise endurance in COPD. Inhaled tiotropium 
bromide therapy has also been associated with reduction in acute exacerbations 
of COPD as well as reduced hospitalizations. The safety profile of tiotropium 
bromide is impressive: dry mouth is the most common adverse event and rarely 
necessitates termination of the drug. No tachyphylaxis to tiotropium bromide has 
been demonstrated in clinical trials lasting up to 1 year. There is preliminary 
information that the combination of long acting anticholinergics and long-acting 
beta2-adrenoceptor agonists provides additive physiological and clinical 
benefits. According to recent international guidelines, long-acting 
bronchodilators should be considered early in the management of symptomatic 
patients with COPD in order to achieve effective symptom alleviation and 
reduction in activity limitation. Tiotropium bromide, because of its once-daily 
administration and its established efficacy and tolerability profile, has 
emerged as an attractive therapeutic option for this condition.

BACKGROUND: Management of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) commonly 
involves long-acting bronchodilators including beta-agonists (LABA) and 
muscarinic antagonists (LAMA). In individuals with persistent symptoms or 
frequent exacerbations, inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) are also used. LABA and 
LAMA bronchodilators are now available in single combination inhalers. However, 
the benefits and risks of adding ICS to combination LABA/LAMA inhalers remains 
unclear.
OBJECTIVES: To assess the effect of adding an inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) to 
combination long-acting beta₂-agonist (LABA)/long-acting muscarinic antagonist 
(LAMA) inhalers for the treatment of stable COPD.
SEARCH METHODS: We carried out searches using the Cochrane Airways Group 
Specialised Register of Trials (searched 20 September 2016), Cochrane Central 
Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; 2015, Issue 12) in the Cochrane Library 
(searched 15 December 2015) and MEDLINE (searched 15 December 2015). We also 
searched ClinicalTrials.gov, World Health Organisation (WHO) trials portal and 
pharmaceutical company clinical trials' databases up to 7 Janurary 2016.
SELECTION CRITERIA: We included parallel-group, randomised controlled trials 
(RCTs) of three weeks' duration or longer which compared treatment of stable 
COPD with ICS in addition to combination LABA/LAMA inhalers against combination 
LABA/LAMA inhalers alone.
DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: We used standard methodological procedures 
expected by Cochrane.
MAIN RESULTS: We identified a total of 586 records in our search. Following 
removal of duplicates, 386 abstracts were assessed for inclusion. Six studies 
were identified as potentially relevant; however, all failed to meet the 
inclusion criteria on full-text assessment or after contacting the corresponding 
author to clarify study characteristics.
AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: There are currently no studies published assessing the 
effect of ICS in addition to combination LABA/LAMA inhalers for the treatment of 
stable COPD. As combination LABA/LAMA inhalers are now widely available, there 
is a need for well-designed RCTs to investigate whether ICS provides any added 
therapeutic benefit.

Identifying patients at risk of exacerbations and managing them appropriately to 
reduce this risk represents an important clinical challenge. Numerous treatments 
have been assessed for the prevention of exacerbations and their efficacy may 
differ by patient phenotype. Given their centrality in the treatment of COPD, 
there is strong rationale for maximizing bronchodilation as an initial strategy 
to reduce exacerbation risk irrespective of patient phenotype. Therefore, in 
patients assessed as frequent exacerbators (>1 exacerbation/year) we propose 
initial bronchodilator treatment with a long-acting muscarinic antagonist 
(LAMA)/ long-acting β2-agonist (LABA). For those patients who continue to 
experience >1 exacerbation/year despite maximal bronchodilation, we advocate 
treating according to patient phenotype. Based on currently available data on 
adding inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) to a LABA, ICS might be added to a 
LABA/LAMA combination in exacerbating patients who have an asthma-COPD overlap 
syndrome or high blood eosinophil counts, while in exacerbators with chronic 
bronchitis, consideration should be given to treating with a phosphodiesterase 
(PDE)-4 inhibitor (roflumilast) or high-dose mucolytic agents. For those 
patients who experience frequent bacterial exacerbations and/or bronchiectasis, 
addition of mucolytic agents or a macrolide antibiotic (e.g. azithromycin) 
should be considered. In all patients at risk of exacerbations, pulmonary 
rehabilitation should be included as part of a comprehensive management plan.

Small airways represent the key factor of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease 
(COPD) pathophysiology. The effect of different classes of bronchodilators on 
small airways is still poorly understood and difficult to assess. Hence the 
acute effects of tiotropium (18 µg) and indacaterol (150 µg) on closing volume 
(CV) and ventilation inhomogeneity were investigated and compared in 51 stable 
patients (aged 70 ± 7 yr, mean ± SD; 82% men) with moderate to very severe COPD. 
Patients underwent body plethysmography, arterial blood gas analysis, tidal 
expiratory flow limitation (EFL), dyspnea assessment, and simultaneous recording 
of single-breath N2 test and transpulmonary pressure-volume curve (PL-V), before 
and 1 h after drug administration. The effects produced by indacaterol on each 
variable did not differ from those caused by tiotropium, independent of the 
severity of disease, assessed according to the Global Initiative for Chronic 
Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (GOLD) scale and the presence of EFL. 
Bronchodilators significantly decreased the slope of phase III and CV (-5 ± 4 
and -2.5 ± 2.1%, respectively, both P < 0.001), with an increase in both slope 
and height of phase IV and of the anatomical dead space. Arterial oxygen 
pressure and saturation significantly improved (3 ± 3 mmHg and 2 ± 2%, 
respectively, both P < 0.001); their changes negatively correlated with those of 
phase III slope (r = -0.659 and r = -0.454, respectively, both P < 0.01). The 
vital capacity (VC) increased substantially, but the PL-V/VC curve above CV was 
unaffected. In conclusion, bronchodilators reduce the heterogeneity of 
peripheral airway mechanical properties and the extent of their closure, with 
minor effects on critical closing pressure. This should lessen the risk of 
small-airway damage and positively affect gas exchange.NEW & NOTEWORTHY This is 
the first study investigating in stable chronic obstructive pulmonary disease 
patients the acute effects of two long-acting bronchodilators, a β-agonist and a 
muscarinic antagonist, on peripheral airways using simultaneous lung 
pressure-volume curve and single-breath N2 test. By lessening airway mechanical 
property heterogeneity, both drugs similarly reduced ventilation inhomogeneity 
and extent of small-airway closure, as indicated by the decrease of phase III 
slope, increased oxygen saturation, and fall of closing volume, often below 
expiratory reserve volume.

Long-acting inhaled therapy (beta-agonists, anticholinergics and steroids) for 
COPD: a network meta-analysis.

BACKGROUND: Pharmacological therapy for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease 
(COPD) is aimed at relieving symptoms, improving quality of life and preventing 
or treating exacerbations.Treatment tends to begin with one inhaler, and 
additional therapies are introduced as necessary. For persistent or worsening 
symptoms, long-acting inhaled therapies taken once or twice daily are preferred 
over short-acting inhalers. Several Cochrane reviews have looked at the risks 
and benefits of specific long-acting inhaled therapies compared with placebo or 
other treatments. However for patients and clinicians, it is important to 
understand the merits of these treatments relative to each other, and whether a 
particular class of inhaled therapies is more beneficial than the others.
OBJECTIVES: To assess the efficacy of treatment options for patients whose 
chronic obstructive pulmonary disease cannot be controlled by short-acting 
therapies alone. The review will not look at combination therapies usually 
considered later in the course of the disease.As part of this network 
meta-analysis, we will address the following issues.1. How does long-term 
efficacy compare between different pharmacological treatments for COPD?2. Are 
there limitations in the current evidence base that may compromise the 
conclusions drawn by this network meta-analysis? If so, what are the 
implications for future research?
SEARCH METHODS: We identified randomised controlled trials (RCTs) in existing 
Cochrane reviews by searching the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews 
(CDSR). In addition, we ran a comprehensive citation search on the Cochrane 
Airways Group Register of trials (CAGR) and checked manufacturer websites and 
reference lists of other reviews. The most recent searches were conducted in 
September 2013.
SELECTION CRITERIA: We included parallel-group RCTs of at least 6 months' 
duration recruiting people with COPD. Studies were included if they compared any 
of the following treatments versus any other: long-acting beta2-agonists (LABAs; 
formoterol, indacaterol, salmeterol); long-acting muscarinic antagonists (LAMAs; 
aclidinium, glycopyrronium, tiotropium); inhaled corticosteroids (ICSs; 
budesonide, fluticasone, mometasone); combination long-acting beta2-agonist 
(LABA) and inhaled corticosteroid (LABA/ICS) (formoterol/budesonide, 
formoterol/mometasone, salmeterol/fluticasone); and placebo.
DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: We conducted a network meta-analysis using Markov 
chain Monte Carlo methods for two efficacy outcomes: St George's Respiratory 
Questionnaire (SGRQ) total score and trough forced expiratory volume in one 
second (FEV1). We modelled the relative effectiveness of any two treatments as a 
function of each treatment relative to the reference treatment (placebo). We 
assumed that treatment effects were similar within treatment classes (LAMA, 
LABA, ICS, LABA/ICS). We present estimates of class effects, variability between 
treatments within each class and individual treatment effects compared with 
every other.To justify the analyses, we assessed the trials for clinical and 
methodological transitivity across comparisons. We tested the robustness of our 
analyses by performing sensitivity analyses for lack of blinding and by 
considering six- and 12-month data separately.
MAIN RESULTS: We identified 71 RCTs randomly assigning 73,062 people with COPD 
to 184 treatment arms of interest. Trials were similar with regards to 
methodology, inclusion and exclusion criteria and key baseline characteristics. 
Participants were more often male, aged in their mid sixties, with FEV1 
predicted normal between 40% and 50% and with substantial smoking histories (40+ 
pack-years). The risk of bias was generally low, although missing information 
made it hard to judge risk of selection bias and selective outcome reporting. 
Fixed effects were used for SGRQ analyses, and random effects for Trough FEV1 
analyses, based on model fit statistics and deviance information criteria (DIC). 
SGRQ SGRQ data were available in 42 studies (n = 54,613). At six months, 39 
pairwise comparisons were made between 18 treatments in 25 studies (n = 27,024). 
Combination LABA/ICS was the highest ranked intervention, with a mean 
improvement over placebo of -3.89 units at six months (95% credible interval 
(CrI) -4.70 to -2.97) and -3.60 at 12 months (95% CrI -4.63 to -2.34). LAMAs and 
LABAs were ranked second and third at six months, with mean differences of -2.63 
(95% CrI -3.53 to -1.97) and -2.29 (95% CrI -3.18 to -1.53), respectively. 
Inhaled corticosteroids were ranked fourth (MD -2.00, 95% CrI -3.06 to -0.87). 
Class differences between LABA, LAMA and ICS were less prominent at 12 months. 
Indacaterol and aclidinium were ranked somewhat higher than other members of 
their classes, and formoterol 12 mcg, budesonide 400 mcg and 
formoterol/mometasone combination were ranked lower within their classes. There 
was considerable overlap in credible intervals and rankings for both classes and 
individual treatments. Trough FEV1 Trough FEV1 data were available in 46 studies 
(n = 47,409). At six months, 41 pairwise comparisons were made between 20 
treatments in 31 studies (n = 29,271). As for SGRQ, combination LABA/ICS was the 
highest ranked class, with a mean improvement over placebo of 133.3 mL at six 
months (95% CrI 100.6 to 164.0) and slightly less at 12 months (mean difference 
(MD) 100, 95% CrI 55.5 to 140.1). LAMAs (MD 103.5, 95% CrI 81.8 to 124.9) and 
LABAs (MD 99.4, 95% CrI 72.0 to 127.8) showed roughly equivalent results at six 
months, and ICSs were the fourth ranked class (MD 65.4, 95% CrI 33.1 to 96.9). 
As with SGRQ, initial differences between classes were not so prominent at 12 
months. Indacaterol and salmeterol/fluticasone were ranked slightly better than 
others in their class, and formoterol 12, aclidinium, budesonide and 
formoterol/budesonide combination were ranked lower within their classes. All 
credible intervals for individual rankings were wide.
AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: This network meta-analysis compares four different classes 
of long-acting inhalers for people with COPD who need more than short-acting 
bronchodilators. Quality of life and lung function were improved most on 
combination inhalers (LABA and ICS) and least on ICS alone at 6 and at 12 
months. Overall LAMA and LABA inhalers had similar effects, particularly at 12 
months. The network has demonstrated the benefit of ICS when added to LABA for 
these outcomes in participants who largely had an FEV1 that was less than 50% 
predicted, but the additional expense of combination inhalers and any potential 
for increased adverse events (which has been established by other reviews) 
require consideration. Our findings are in keeping with current National 
Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) guidelines.

Background: Long-acting muscarinic antagonists (LAMAs) and long-acting 
β2-agonists (LABAs) are the mainstay of maintenance therapy for chronic 
obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Although previous studies have supported 
inhaled long-acting bronchodilators (ILABs) for overall cardiovascular safety, 
the risk of specific cardiovascular outcomes such as arrhythmia, heart failure 
and stroke is still unknown. Materials and methods: We systematically searched 
from PubMed, the Embase database and the Cochrane Library for published studies 
on ILABs and COPD, from its inception to November 10, 2018, with no language 
restrictions. The RRs and corresponding 95% CIs were pooled to evaluate 
ILAB/placebo. Results: Finally, 43 randomized controlled trials were included. 
Compared with placebo, ILABs do not increase the risk of overall and specific 
cardiovascular adverse events (AEs); on the contrary, they can reduce the 
incidence of hypertension (RR 0.73, 95% CI 0.55-0.98;I219.9%; P= 0.221). 
However, when stratified according to the specific agents of ILABs, olodaterol 
might reduce the risk of overall cardiovascular adverse events (OCAEs) (RR 0.65, 
95% CI 0.49-0.88;I227.5%; P= 0.000), and the protective effect of lowing blood 
pressure disappeared. Similarly, the use of inhaled LABA might increase the risk 
of cardiac failure (RR 1.71, 95% CI 1.04-2.84;I20%; P= 0.538), but this risk 
disappeared when stratified according to the specific agents of LABA. Besides, 
formoterol might decrease the risk of cardiac ischemia (RR 0.53, 95% CI 
0.32-0.91; I20%; P= 0.676). Conclusions: Overall, the use of ILABs was not 
associated with overall cardiovascular AEs in patients with stable COPD. When 
stratified according to the specific agents of LABA, olodaterol might reduce the 
risk of OCAE; and formoterol might decrease the risk of cardiac ischemia. LABA 
might reduce the incidence of hypertension, but might increase the risk of heart 
failure. Therefore, COPD patients with a history of heart failure should use it 
with caution.

Toledo, OH, USA.

OBJECTIVE: To compare the available literature regarding the use of long-acting 
muscarinic antagonist (LAMA)/long-acting β2 agonists (LABA) and inhaled 
corticosteroid (ICS)/LABA combination inhaler therapy in chronic obstructive 
pulmonary disease (COPD) maintenance therapy management.
DATA SOURCES: A MEDLINE literature search from database inception to February 
2017 was conducted using the search terms chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, 
adrenergic beta-agonist, muscarinic antagonist, and inhaled corticosteroid. 
References from extracted sources were further searched for any relevant, missed 
data sources.
STUDY SELECTION AND DATA EXTRACTION: All English-language randomized-controlled 
trials comparing LAMA/LABA and ICS/LABA combination inhaler therapy were 
evaluated.
DATA SYNTHESIS: A total of 10 randomized controlled trials have reviewed the use 
of LAMA/LABA compared with ICS/LABA therapy for COPD maintenance therapy. 
Results of clinical trials that evaluated LAMA/LABA and ICS/LABA maintenance 
therapy demonstrated superior improvements in pulmonary function tests via 
spirometry and improved clinical outcomes with LAMA/LABA therapy, specifically 
reduction in COPD exacerbation rates. The safety of LAMA/LABA combination 
therapy also is favorable compared with ICS/LABA combination therapy because of 
the increased infection risk with ICS therapy.
CONCLUSIONS: COPD is a disease state with significant morbidity and mortality in 
the United States and is the third leading cause of death. Long-acting inhalers 
are recommended for the majority of COPD severities, and combination therapy is 
typically utilized. LAMA/LABA combination therapy has demonstrated superior 
improvements in pulmonary function and reduction in COPD exacerbation rates 
compared with ICS/LABA. LAMA/LABA combination therapy will have a larger future 
role in COPD maintenance management.

BACKGROUND: The FLAME study demonstrated that indacaterol/glycopyrronium 
(IND/GLY), the fixed-dose combination of a long-acting β2-agonist (LABA, IND) 
and a long-acting muscarinic antagonist (LAMA, GLY), was superior to 
salmeterol/fluticasone combination (SFC) in preventing exacerbations in COPD 
patients with a high risk of exacerbations. In this study, we report a 
prespecified analysis of the efficacy and safety of IND/GLY versus SFC in Asian 
patients from the FLAME study.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients from Asian centers with moderate-to-very severe 
COPD and ≥1 exacerbation in the previous year from the 52-week, randomized FLAME 
study were included. IND/GLY was compared versus SFC for effects on 
exacerbations, lung function (forced expiratory volume in 1 second [FEV1] and 
forced vital capacity [FVC]), health status (St George's Respiratory 
Questionnaire [SGRQ]), rescue medication use, and safety.
RESULTS: A total of 510 Asian patients (IND/GLY, n=250 or SFC, n=260) were 
included. Compared to the overall FLAME population, the Asian cohort had more 
males, a shorter duration of COPD, fewer patients using inhaled corticosteroid 
(ICS) at screening, fewer current smokers, and more patients with very severe 
COPD. IND/GLY significantly reduced the rate of moderate/severe exacerbations 
(rate ratio: 0.75; 95% confidence interval: 0.58-0.97; P=0.027) and prolonged 
time to first moderate/severe exacerbation versus SFC (hazard ratio: 0.77; 95% 
confidence interval: 0.59-1.01; P=0.055). Predose trough FEV1 and FVC 
significantly improved in Asian patients (P<0.001). IND/GLY improved SGRQ for 
COPD (SGRQ-C score; P=0.006) and reduced rescue medication use (P=0.058) at week 
52. Pneumonia incidence was 3.6% with IND/GLY and 7.7% with SFC (P=0.046).
CONCLUSION: In exacerbating Asian COPD patients, IND/GLY was more effective than 
SFC.

BACKGROUND: Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), a largely preventable 
and manageable respiratory condition, affects an estimated 12% to 20% of adults. 
Long-acting inhaled β-agonists and anticholinergics have both been shown to 
improve COPD outcomes and are recommended for moderate to severe disease; 
however, little is known about their comparative effectiveness.
OBJECTIVE: To compare survival in older patients with COPD who initially receive 
inhaled long-acting β-agonists with that of patients who receive 
anticholinergics.
DESIGN: Population-based, retrospective cohort study.
SETTING: Ontario, Canada.
PATIENTS: Patients aged 66 years or older (who carry the largest burden of COPD 
and for whom data were available) who met a validated case definition of COPD on 
the basis of health administrative data and were newly prescribed an inhaled 
long-acting β-agonist or a long acting anticholinergic (but not both) between 
2003 and 2007. Patients were followed for up to 5.5 years.
MEASUREMENTS: The primary outcome was all-cause mortality.
RESULTS: A total of 46 403 patients with COPD (mean age, 77 years; 49% women) 
were included. Overall mortality was 38.2%. Mortality was higher in patients 
initially prescribed a long acting anticholinergic than in those initially 
prescribed a long-acting inhaled β-agonist (adjusted hazard ratio, 1.14 [95% CI, 
1.09 to 1.19]). Rates of hospitalizations and emergency department visits were 
also higher in those initially prescribed a long acting anticholinergic.
LIMITATION: Patients were classified as having COPD on the basis of health 
administrative records, which did not contain information about lung function.
CONCLUSION: Older adults initially prescribed long-acting inhaled β-agonists for 
the management of moderate COPD seem to have lower mortality than those 
initially prescribed long acting anticholinergics. Further research is needed to 
confirm these findings in younger patients and in a randomized, controlled 
trial.

Inhaled bronchodilator medications are central to the management of COPD and are 
frequently given on a regular basis to prevent or reduce symptoms. While 
short-acting bronchodilators are a treatment option for people with relatively 
few COPD symptoms and at low risk of exacerbations, for the majority of patients 
with significant breathlessness at the time of diagnosis, long-acting 
bronchodilators may be required. Dual bronchodilation with a long-acting 
β2-agonist and long-acting muscarinic antagonist may be more effective treatment 
for some of these patients, with the aim of improving symptoms. This combination 
may also reduce the rate of exacerbations compared with a bronchodilator-inhaled 
corticosteroid combination in those with a history of exacerbations. However, 
there is currently a lack of guidance on clinical indicators suggesting which 
patients should step up from mono- to dual bronchodilation. In this article, we 
discuss a number of clinical indicators that could prompt a patient and 
physician to consider treatment escalation, while being mindful of the need to 
avoid unnecessary polypharmacy. These indicators include insufficient 
symptomatic response, a sustained increased requirement for rescue medication, 
suboptimal 24-hour symptom control, deteriorating symptoms, the occurrence of 
exacerbations, COPD-related hospitalization, and reductions in lung function. 
Future research is required to provide a better understanding of the optimal 
timing and benefits of treatment escalation and to identify the appropriate 
tools to inform this decision.

INTRODUCTION: We performed a real-life retrospective analysis to assess the 
impact of long-acting bronchodilator therapy and associated exposure to inhaled 
corticosteroids (ICS) on all-cause and cardiovascular mortality in patients with 
chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).
METHODS: We used record linkage data from patients with a diagnosis of COPD in 
Tayside, Scotland, between 2001 and 2010. All-cause and cardiovascular mortality 
were assessed using Cox proportional hazard regression.
RESULTS: A total of 4,133 patients were included, mean FEV1 of 59.5%, mean age 
of 68.9 years and mean follow-up of 4.6 years. There were 623 who were exposed 
to long-acting bronchodilators only and 3,510 to long-acting bronchodilators 
plus ICS. 1,372 patients (33%) died during the study period. Compared with 
controls taking only long-acting bronchodilators either alone or in combination, 
all-cause mortality was reduced in patients taking long-acting muscarinic 
antagonist (LAMA) + ICS as dual therapy: adjusted hazard ratio 0.62 (95% CI 
0.45-0.85), but not by long-acting beta-agonist (LABA) + ICS: adjusted hazard 
ratio 1.02 (95% CI 0.80-1.31). Cardiovascular mortality was not reduced by dual 
therapy with either LABA or LAMA and concomitant ICS exposure. All-cause and 
cardiovascular mortality were both reduced in patients taking triple therapy 
with LABA + LAMA + ICS: adjusted hazard ratio 0.51 (95% CI 0.41-0.64) and 0.56 
(95% CI 0.35-0.90), respectively.
CONCLUSION: In patients exposed to ICS, concomitant use of LAMA alone as dual 
therapy or in combination with LABA as triple therapy were associated with 
reductions in all-cause mortality, while concomitant use of LABA without LAMA 
conferred no reduction. Moreover, only triple therapy was found to confer 
benefits on cardiovascular mortality.

The long-acting inhaled bronchodilators available for use in chronic obstructive 
pulmonary disease (COPD) vary in their pharmacological class (β2-adrenergic 
agonist or antimuscarinic/anticholinergic, alone or combined), durations of 
action and speed of onset of bronchodilator effect. In the early stages of 
development of a maintenance bronchodilator, the goals are to identify a 
molecule with the theoretically 'ideal' profile of fast onset and prolonged 
duration of action in comparison with existing agents, while minimizing 
non-specific activity at organs outside the lungs. The move towards increasing 
duration of bronchodilator action is generally paralleled by improved effects on 
clinical outcomes, and the advent of more potent agents seems likely to provide 
an opportunity to reduce overreliance on the use of inhaled corticosteroids in 
treating COPD. In terms of onset of action, an immediately perceived benefit in 
reducing dyspnea, although not definitively demonstrated, might prove useful in 
increasing adherence, which is very poor among patients with COPD. Once-daily 
administration may also be helpful in this respect. Shared decision-making 
between patient and physician in the choice of treatment is important in 
optimizing adherence and, thus, treatment effectiveness.

Indacaterol/glycopyrronium (IND/GLY) 110/50mcg was the first once-daily, 
long-acting β2-agonist (LABA)/long-acting muscarinic antagonist (LAMA) 
fixed-dose combination (FDC) approved in Europe for the treatment of chronic 
obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Development of IND/GLY was driven by the 
need to improve the standard of care for patients with this disease, in terms of 
symptom control and exacerbation frequency. IGNITE, an adaptive, comprehensive, 
and innovative Phase 3 development program, demonstrated the efficacy of IND/GLY 
in optimising bronchodilation, reducing symptoms, and reducing exacerbations in 
patients with COPD. IGNITE challenged contemporary thinking about the 
pharmacological treatment and management of patients with this disease.

To ensure consistency of clinical outcomes, orally inhaled therapies must 
exhibit consistent delivered dose and aerosol properties at the time of 
manufacturing, throughout storage, and during various patient-use conditions. 
Achieving consistency across these scenarios has presented a significant 
challenge, especially for combination products that contain more than one drug. 
This study characterized the delivered dose and aerosol properties of 
glycopyrrolate/formoterol fumarate metered dose inhaler (GFF MDI; Bevespi 
Aerosphere™). GFF MDI, a fixed-dose combination (FDC) of a long-acting 
muscarinic antagonist, glycopyrrolate (18 μg, equivalent to glycopyrronium 
14.4 μg), and a long-acting β2-agonist, formoterol fumarate (9.6 μg; equivalent 
to formoterol fumarate dihydrate 10 μg), is formulated using innovative 
co-suspension delivery technology, which suspends micronized drug crystals with 
spray-dried phospholipid porous particles in hydrofluoroalkane propellant. In 
this study, delivered dose uniformity was assessed through the labeled number of 
doses, and aerosol properties, such as percent fine particle fraction (FPF) and 
mass median aerodynamic diameter, were determined by cascade impaction. GFF MDI 
achieved reproducible dose delivery and an FPF greater than 55%, whether 
formulated and delivered as a monocomponent or dual FDC. The performance of GFF 
MDI was maintained across various manufacturing batches, under extended storage, 
and with variations in flow rate. Furthermore, unlike a GFF drug crystal-only 
suspension, drug delivery remained consistent for GFF MDI when simulated 
patient-handling errors were applied, such as reduced shake energy and delays 
between shaking and actuation. These results demonstrate that co-suspension 
delivery technology overcomes well-known sources of variability in MDI drug 
delivery.

BACKGROUND: Tiotropium has been shown to improve lung function, quality of life, 
and exacerbations and reduce mortality when compared with placebo in COPD. It 
remains unclear whether benefits are seen when tiotropium is used in conjunction 
with inhaled corticosteroids (ICSs) plus long-acting β-agonists (LABAs).
METHODS: We performed a retrospective cohort study using a National Health 
Service database of patients with COPD in Tayside, Scotland, between 2001 and 
2010 that is linked with databases regarding hospital admissions, pharmacy 
prescriptions, and death registries. The impact of the addition of tiotropium 
(Tio) to ICS + LABA therapy on all-cause mortality, hospital admissions for 
respiratory disease, and emergency oral corticosteroid bursts was evaluated. 
Adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) were calculated by Cox regression after inclusion 
of the following covariates: cardiovascular and respiratory disease, diabetes, 
smoking, age, sex, and deprivation index.
RESULTS: A total of 1,857 patients were given ICS + LABA + Tio, and 996 were 
given ICS + LABA. Mean follow-up was 4.65 years. The adjusted HR for all-cause 
mortality for ICS + LABA + Tio vs ICS + LABA was 0.65 (95% CI, 0.57-0.75; P < 
.001). Adjusted HRs for hospital admissions and oral corticosteroid bursts were 
0.85 (95% CI, 0.73-0.99; P = .04) and 0.71 (95% CI, 0.63-0.80; P < .001), 
respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: The study suggests that the addition of tiotropium to ICSs and LABA 
therapy may confer benefits in reducing all-cause mortality, hospital 
admissions, and oral corticosteroid bursts in patients with COPD. Triple therapy 
is widely used in the real-life management of COPD, with only limited scientific 
support. The study supports the use of triple therapy in COPD and provides a 
platform for randomized controlled trials specifically addressing this topic.

Outcomes in Patients With Stable COPD: A Bayesian Network Meta-Analysis of 
Randomized Controlled Trials.

A majority of existing studies have focused on the efficacy of inhaled 
long-acting bronchodilators (ILABs), such as long-acting muscarinic antagonists 
(LAMAs) and long-acting β2-agonists (LABAs), and LABAs combined with LAMAs in 
treating chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). The current meta-analysis 
aimed to investigate the correlation of ILABs with specific cardiovascular 
adverse events (CAEs). Five electronic databases, including PubMed, Embase, 
Cochrane Library, Scopus, and Web of Science were systematically retrieved. 
Finally, 16 randomized controlled trials were enrolled into the current 
meta-analysis. Typically, the efficacy of 3 major classes of drugs (LABAs, 
LAMAs, and LABAs combined with LAMAs), and 7 specific drugs (including 
formoterol, glycopyrrolate, indacaterol, olodaterol, Salmeterol, tiotropium, and 
vilanterol) for 4 CAEs, including myocardial infarction, cardiac failure (CF), 
ischemic heart disease (IHD), and stroke in stable COPD patients, was examined. 
All the pooled results were analyzed through the odds ratios (ORs) with the 
corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CIs). The direct meta-analysis results 
suggested that LABAs could increase the risk of CF in patients with stable COPD 
compared with placebo controls (OR 1.70, 95% CI, 1.00-2.90). In addition, 
network meta-analysis results indicated that LAMAs combined with LABAs would 
result in an increased risk of CF in patients with stable COPD (OR 2.31, 95% CI, 
1.10-5.09). According to the ILABs specific drug analysis, formoterol may 
potentially have protective effects on IHD compared with placebo controls (OR 
0.45, 95% CI, 0.18-1.00). In conclusion, among these 3 kinds of ILABs, including 
LAMAs, LABAs, and LABAs/LAMAs, for stable COPD patients, LAMAs and LABAs are 
associated with the least possibility to induce myocardial infarction and 
stroke, respectively. However, the application of LABAs will probably increase 
the risk of CF; they should be used with caution for stable COPD patients with 
CF. In addition, in specific-drug analysis, the use of formoterol can reduce the 
risk of treatment-related IHD. Nevertheless, more studies on different drug 
doses are needed in the future to further validate this conclusion.

In asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), an important step in 
simplifying management and improving adherence with prescribed therapy is to 
reduce the dose frequency to the minimum necessary to maintain disease control. 
Fixed-dose combination (FDC) therapy might enhance compliance by decreasing the 
number of medications and/or the number of daily doses. Furthermore, they have 
the potential for enhancing, sensitizing, and prolonging the effects of 
monocomponents. Combination therapy with an inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) and a 
long-acting β-agonist (LABA) is considered an important approach for treating 
patients with asthma and patients with severe COPD who have frequent 
exacerbations. Several ICS/LABA FDCs are now commercially available or will 
become available within the next few years for the treatment of COPD and/or 
asthma. Several studies demonstrate that there are a number of added benefits in 
using combinations of β2-agonists and antimuscarinic agents. In particular, 
LABA/long-acting antimuscarinic agent (LAMA) combination seems to play an 
important role in optimizing bronchodilation. Several once-daily and twice-daily 
LABA/LAMA FDCs have been developed or are in clinical development. LAMA/ICS FDCs 
seem to be useful in COPD and mainly in asthma, in patients with severe asthma 
and persistent airflow limitation. The rationale behind the ICS/LABA/LAMA FDCs 
seems logical because all three agents work via different mechanisms on 
different targets, potentially allowing for lower doses of the individual agents 
to be used, accompanied by improved side effect profiles. In effect, in clinical 
practice, concomitant use of all three compounds is common, especially in more 
severe COPD but also in the treatment of adults with poorly controlled asthma 
despite maintenance treatment with high-dose ICS and a LABA.

The incidence of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is rising in the 
United States, and the disease represents a significant source of morbidity and 
mortality. Primary care providers face many challenges in COPD diagnosis and 
treatment, as different clinical phenotypes require personalized treatment 
approaches. Patient adherence and inhaler technique also contribute to treatment 
outcomes. Around 48% of primary care providers are unaware of guidelines and 
recommendations for COPD diagnosis and treatment, which may lead to misdiagnosis 
or undertreatment of COPD symptoms. Inadequately treated COPD can impair 
patients' quality of life and ability to perform everyday activities. 
Long-acting bronchodilator therapy is the cornerstone treatment for patients 
with COPD; combinations of bronchodilators of different pharmacological classes 
have shown improved efficacy vs monotherapy. We review the rationale behind 
fixed-dose dual bronchodilator therapy, evidence for the 4 currently Food and 
Drug Administration-approved long acting anticholinergic 
bronchodilators/long-acting β2-agonists fixed combinations, patient suitability 
for the available inhaler devices, and practical guidance to optimize 
personalized care for patients with COPD.

A number of new agents for the management of chronic obstructive pulmonary 
disease (COPD) are at different stages of development, including several inhaled 
long-acting antimuscarinics (LAMA). Long-acting bronchodilators are considered 
to be central to the management of COPD due to the evidence supporting their 
efficacy and safety. Umeclidinium, a LAMA, has recently been approved for the 
maintenance treatment of moderate to very severe COPD in a number of countries. 
This comprehensive review and pooled meta-analysis provides detailed information 
about the efficacy and safety of this agent. The pharmacokinetics and 
pharmacodynamics of umeclidinium observed in phase I and II studies support its 
once-daily administration. Umeclidinium is rapidly cleared from blood, and renal 
or hepatic impairment do not lead to significant changes in drug disposition. A 
pooled analysis of phase III and comparative studies of umeclidinium in patients 
with moderate to very severe COPD showed significant improvement in lung 
function measures, including trough forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1), as 
well as in acute exacerbations of COPD, dyspnea, and quality of life. Adverse 
effects, including known anticholinergic effects, were uncommon with 
umeclidinium. Limited data suggest the efficacy of umeclidinium is similar to 
that of tiotropium. Umeclidinium is administered as a dry powder inhaler, 
provides adequate lung delivery in patients with moderate to very severe airflow 
obstruction, and appears to be easily used by patients. Umeclidinium provides a 
safe and effective option as an inhaled LAMA for the management of COPD.

BACKGROUND: Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a heterogeneous 
disorder characterized by usually progressive development of airflow obstruction 
that is not fully reversible. While most patients will experience symptoms 
throughout the day or in the morning upon awakening, many patients do not 
experience their symptoms as constant but report variability in symptoms during 
the course of the day or over time. Symptom variability adversely affects 
patients' health status and increases the risk of COPD exacerbations.
METHODS: We examined data from the literature on symptom variability and control 
in patients with COPD, with focus on the use of inhaled bronchodilator therapy 
with long-acting muscarinic antagonist agents (LAMA) plus long-acting 
β2-agonists (LABA); in particular twice-daily fixed-dose combination LAMA/LABA 
therapy with aclidinium/formoterol.
RESULTS: Correct diagnosis and assessment of COPD requires comprehensive 
clinical and functional evaluation and consideration of individual needs to 
support the clinical decisions necessary for effective long-term management. 
Combining bronchodilators from different and complementary pharmacological 
classes with distinct mechanisms of action can increase the magnitude of 
bronchodilation as opposed to increasing the dose of a single bronchodilator.
CONCLUSIONS: The use of inhaled bronchodilator therapy with LAMA/LABA fixed-dose 
combinations in patients with stable COPD is supported by current evidence. This 
treatment approach provides robust effects on lung function and symptom control 
and may improve patients' adherence to treatment. Administration of the 
long-acting bronchodilators aclidinium and formoterol as twice daily fixed-dose 
aclidinium/formoterol 400/12 μg has the potential to control symptoms throughout 
the 24 h in patients with stable moderate-to-severe COPD.

University, Nürnberg, Germany.

BACKGROUND: Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is common around the 
world and carries a high morbidity and mortality. Symptom- and risk-oriented 
drug treatment is recommended, both in Germany and in other countries. It is not 
yet known to what extent the treatment that is actually delivered in Germany 
corresponds to the current recommendations in the guidelines.
METHODS: As recommended by the Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung 
Disease (GOLD) in 2017, 2281 patients of the national COPD cohort COSYCONET 
(COPD and Systemic Consequences-Comorbidities Network) were classified into Gold 
classes A-D on the basis of disease-specific manifestations and the frequency of 
exacerbations. Moreover, the regular use of medications was documented and 
categorized according to active substance groups. For all groups, the documented 
treatment that was actually given was compared to the recommended treatment.
RESULTS: 67.6% of the patients received a combination of a long-acting 
anticholinergic drug (LAMA) and a long-acting beta-mimetic drug (LABA), while 
65.8% received inhaled corticosteroids (ICS), 11.7% theophylline, and 12.6% oral 
corticosteroids (OCS). Despite recommendations to the contrary, 66% of the 
patients in Groups A and B (low exacerbation rates) were treated with ICS; some 
of these patients carried an additional diagnosis of bronchial asthma. There was 
evidence of undertreatment mainly in groups C and D (high exacerbation rate), 
because many of the patients in these groups were not treated with LAMA or 
LAMA/LABA as recommended.
CONCLUSION: The observed deviations from the recommended treatment, some of 
which were substantial, might lead to suboptimal treatment outcomes as well as 
to avoidable side effects of medication.

BACKGROUND: Guidelines recommend that treatment with a long-acting β2 agonist 
(LABA), a long-acting muscarinic antagonist (LAMA), and inhaled corticosteroids 
(ICS), i.e. triple therapy, is reserved for a select group of symptomatic 
patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) who continue to 
exacerbate despite treatment with dual therapy (LABA/LAMA). A number of 
single-inhaler triple therapies are now available and important clinical 
questions remain over their role in the patient pathway. We compared the 
efficacy and safety of single-inhaler triple therapy to assess the magnitude of 
benefit and to identify patients with the best risk-benefit profile for 
treatment. We also evaluated and compared study designs and population 
characteristics to assess the strength of the evidence base.
METHODS: We conducted a systematic search, from inception to December 2018, of 
randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of single-inhaler triple therapy in patients 
with COPD. The primary outcome was the annual rate of moderate and severe 
exacerbations.
RESULTS: We identified 523 records, of which 15 reports/abstracts from six RCTs 
were included. Triple therapy resulted in the reduction of the annual rate of 
moderate or severe exacerbations in the range of 15-52% compared with LAMA/LABA, 
15-35% compared to LABA/ICS and 20% compared to LAMA. The patient-based number 
needed to treat for the moderate or severe exacerbation outcome ranged between 
approximately 25-50 (preventing one patient from having an event) and the 
event-based number needed to treat of around 3-11 (preventing one event). The 
absolute benefit appeared to be greater in patients with higher eosinophil 
counts or historical frequency of exacerbations and ex-smokers. In the largest 
study, there was a significantly higher incidence of pneumonia in the triple 
therapy arm. There were important differences in study designs and populations 
impacting the interpretation of the results and indicating there would be 
significant heterogeneity in cross-trial comparisons.
CONCLUSION: The decision to prescribe triple therapy should consider patient 
phenotype, magnitude of benefit and increased risk of adverse events. Future 
research on specific patient phenotype thresholds that can support treatment and 
funding decisions is now required from well-designed, robust, clinical trials.

In this review, we summarize the rationale for combining long-acting 
bronchodilators in the management of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease 
(COPD), and the evidence for the long-acting bronchodilator combination 
indacaterol/glycopyrronium (IND/GLY). Clinical practice guidelines generally 
recommend the use of long-acting bronchodilators in the treatment of patients 
with all severities of COPD, either as a first-choice or alternative-choice 
therapy. Combining classes of long-acting bronchodilators can result in superior 
improvements in lung function and clinical outcomes compared with bronchodilator 
monotherapy, as observed in studies of free combinations of long-acting 
β2-agonists (LABAs) and long-acting muscarinic antagonists (LAMAs). LABA/LAMA 
fixed-dose combinations (FDCs) can also significantly improve lung function, 
dyspnea, symptoms and health status and reduce exacerbations and rescue 
medication use versus an inhaled corticosteroid/LABA, with a comparable safety 
profile and lower incidence of pneumonia. The LABA/LAMA FDC of IND/GLY is 
approved for use in the management of COPD. This review summarizes the evidence 
for IND/GLY, including its pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic profile, and 
published efficacy and safety data from clinical trials in patients with COPD. 
We also explore the unmet needs in COPD and discuss the potential future of COPD 
management.

long acting anticholinergic use in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease: 
efficacy and safety.

UCLA, California 90095-1690, USA. dtashkin@mednet.ucla.edu

PURPOSE OF REVIEW: This article reviews findings from recently published 
randomized controlled trials and systematic reviews to provide an up-to-date 
assessment of the efficacy and safety of tiotropium, the only currently 
available long-acting muscarinic antagonist, when used alone or in conjunction 
with other respiratory medications in the treatment of chronic obstructive 
pulmonary disease (COPD).
RECENT FINDINGS: Results of recent clinical trials support findings from earlier 
trials in patients with moderate to very severe COPD demonstrating significant 
benefits of tiotropium compared to placebo, including sustained increases in 
lung function, reductions in exacerbations and risk of exacerbation-related 
hospitalizations, and improvement in health status. These benefits were 
particularly noted in the 4-year UPLIFT study that included 5993 COPD patients, 
including a large percentage with moderate severity. Whereas the cardiovascular 
safety of tiotropium has been questioned, results of the UPLIFT trial and a 
recent pooled analysis of data from 30 trials of tiotropium demonstrated that 
tiotropium is associated with reductions in the risk of all-cause mortality, 
cardiovascular mortality and cardiovascular events.
SUMMARY: Recent findings confirm the benefits of tiotropium in COPD management 
and provide reassurance regarding its safety. Moreover, the recent UPLIFT trial 
provides supportive evidence for the efficacy of tiotropium in COPD patients 
already receiving treatment with long-acting inhaled beta-agonists and inhaled 
corticosteroids, suggesting advantages of 'triple' therapy in advanced disease. 
Further, well designed, adequately powered studies should explore the potential 
advantages and disadvantages of various combinations of currently available 
long-acting respiratory medications in COPD, particularly in different clinical 
phenotypes of this heterogeneous disease.

Maintenance therapy in COPD: time to phase out ICS and switch to the new 
LAMA/LABA inhalers?

Long-term maintenance therapy for COPD is evolving rapidly. Dual bronchodilation 
with new long-acting muscarinic antagonist and long-acting beta-agonist 
(LAMA/LABA) fixed dose combination inhalers were introduced over the past 2 
years. In clinical trials, these inhalers significantly improved lung function 
(trough forced expiratory volume in 1 second), patient-reported outcomes, and 
quality of life measures compared with placebo, their respective monocomponents, 
and tiotropium. The recorded adverse events of these new inhalers were also 
similar to those of their monocomponents or placebo. There are concerns 
regarding long-term complications (weight gain, osteoporosis, cataract) and 
increased risk of community-acquired pneumonia with the use of inhaled 
corticosteroids (ICS). The new LAMA/LABA inhalers could potentially reduce the 
use of ICS as part and parcel of maintenance therapy in COPD. Recent studies 
compared these LAMA/LABA inhalers with ICS/LABA combination inhalers in 
moderate-to-severe COPD. The results are promising and favor the LAMA/LABA 
inhalers, especially in the longer duration trials. Furthermore, there is a 
clearer picture emerging as to the subgroup of COPD patients who may be able to 
successfully switch from their current ICS/LABA therapy to these new LAMA/LABA 
inhalers.

Tiotropium/Olodaterol: A Review in COPD.

Tiotropium/olodaterol (Stiolto™ Respimat®, Spiolto™ Respimat®) is a fixed-dose 
combination of the long-acting antimuscarinic agent tiotropium bromide 
(hereafter referred to as tiotropium) and the long-acting β2-adrenoreceptor 
agonist olodaterol delivered via the Respimat® Soft Mist™ inhaler. It is 
indicated for the maintenance treatment of airflow obstruction in adults with 
COPD. Several randomized, phase III studies of 6-52 weeks' duration evaluated 
the efficacy of once-daily tiotropium/olodaterol in patients with GOLD stage 2-3 
or 2-4 COPD. Tiotropium/olodaterol maintenance therapy improved lung function to 
a greater extent than the individual components or placebo and provided 
clinically meaningful improvements in health-related quality of life and 
dyspnoea in 12- and 52-week studies. Tiotropium/olodaterol consistently improved 
24-h lung function in 6-week studies, providing greater benefits than the 
monotherapies, placebo or twice-daily fixed-dose fluticasone 
propionate/salmeterol. Inspiratory capacity and exercise endurance were also 
improved with tiotropium/olodaterol following 6 or 12 weeks' treatment. The 
tolerability profile of tiotropium/olodaterol in the phase III studies was 
generally similar to that of the component monotherapies. The most common 
adverse events and serious adverse events during 52 weeks' therapy were 
respiratory in nature, with COPD exacerbation, unsurprisingly, reported most 
frequently with tiotropium/olodaterol and component monotherapies. Although 
additional data assessing the effect of tiotropium/olodaterol on exacerbations 
and comparative studies with other recommended therapies are needed to 
definitively position tiotropium/olodaterol, current evidence indicates that 
tiotropium/olodaterol is a useful treatment option for patients with COPD.

Anticholinergic drugs in asthma therapy.

Specialty Hospital 'A. Cardarelli' dUniversity of Naples Federico II, School of 
Specialization in Respiratory Diseases, Naples, Italy.

PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Current guidelines recommend a stepwise approach for 
pharmacological therapy aimed to achieve and maintain asthma control. Despite 
these recommendations, at least 50% of patients continue to be uncontrolled with 
risk of asthma exacerbations that can often be serious and are associated with 
deterioration of quality of life. In recent years, the interest in 
anticholinergic bronchodilators, which have been primarily used in the treatment 
of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, has increased patients with 
uncontrolled asthma. This review analyzes the mechanisms for the proposed 
clinical use of anticholinergic bronchodilators as an adjunctive therapy in 
asthma.
RECENT FINDINGS: Based on existing and recent evidence, the use of 
anticholinergic bronchodilators, particularly long-acting muscarinic antagonists 
(LAMAs), plays an important role as add-on therapy in patients uncontrolled on 
existing therapies. In particular, the use of anticholinergics in asthma may 
have a role in patients intolerant to long-acting β2 agonist, in patients with 
certain pharmacogenetic profiles and in those patients with asthma symptoms 
mostly at night.
SUMMARY: Data from clinical trials and from real-life confirm the safety and 
efficacy of LAMAs, especially tiotropium, in patients who remain uncontrolled 
despite the use of inhaled corticosteroid therapy.

Long-acting bronchodilators are central in the management of chronic obstructive 
pulmonary disease (COPD). This short review provides an overview of the studies 
evaluating the safety and efficacy of inhaled glycopyrronium, a long-acting 
muscarinic antagonist, in patients with COPD. Glycopyrronium has clinically 
important effects on the level of forced expiratory volume in the first second, 
use of rescue medication, daytime dyspnoea scores, and health status. 
Glycopyrronium also has beneficial effects on dynamic hyperinflation, exercise 
tolerance, and the rate of exacerbations. Glycopyrronium seems to have the 
potential for a significant role in the future management of COPD.

COPD is highly prevalent in the US and globally, requiring new treatment 
strategies due to the high disease burden and increase in the aging population. 
Here, we profile the newly FDA-approved LONHALA MAGNAIR (glycopyrrolate 
[GLY]/eFlow® Closed System [CS]; 25 mcg twice daily), a nebulized long-acting 
muscarinic antagonist (LAMA) for the long-term maintenance treatment of COPD, 
including chronic bronchitis and/or emphysema. Areas covered: An overview of 
COPD and treatment landscape, focusing on GLY/eFlow CS, reviewing the published 
literature pertinent to the drug/device combination is reported. Expert 
commentary: GLY/eFlow CS consists of glycopyrrolate delivered via a novel 
electronic nebulizer and is the first nebulized LAMA to be approved by the FDA. 
GLY/eFlow CS has been studied in an extensive clinical development program, 
including phase II dose-ranging studies, two 12-week phase III studies 
demonstrating statistically significant and clinically important improvements in 
pulmonary function and patient-reported outcomes with a well-tolerated safety 
profile, and a 48-week phase III study highlighting the long-term safety of 
GLY/eFlow CS, along with long-term improvements in lung function and 
patient-reported outcomes. Additional studies are required to assess the impact 
of GLY/eFlow CS on COPD exacerbations, identify alternative uses of the eFlow CS 
nebulizer, and direct comparisons to other LAMAs.

The scientific rationale for combining long-acting beta2-agonists and muscarinic 
antagonists in COPD.

Bronchodilators are the cornerstone of pharmacological management of COPD. For 
patients whose conditions are not sufficiently controlled by monotherapy, 
combining bronchodilators of different classes, in particular an inhaled 
muscarinic antagonist with an inhaled beta(2)-agonist, seems a convenient way of 
delivering treatment and obtaining superior results. When administered as 
combination therapy, short-acting bronchodilators provide superior 
bronchodilation compared with individual agents given alone. More recently, 
long-acting beta(2)-agonists (LABAs) and muscarinic antagonists (LAMAs) have 
been introduced, and current guidelines recommend regular use of these agents 
alone or as concurrent therapy in COPD to maximize bronchodilation. In 
particular, the combination of a LABA plus LAMA seems to play an important role. 
This article illustrates the scientific rationale for combining LABAs and LAMAs 
in COPD, reviews the clinical evidence to support these agents given in 
combination, and discusses their potential role in the management of patients 
with COPD.

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is associated with high morbidity 
and mortality. COPD is typified by persistent, progressive airflow limitation 
and a range of respiratory and systemic symptoms such as breathlessness, 
coughing, wheezing, depression, anxiety, general fatigue, and sleeping 
difficulties. Despite receiving treatment for COPD, many patients suffer from 
regular symptoms that affect their daily lives and lead to increased morbidity. 
These symptoms vary in severity, frequency, and type, and can occur at any time 
throughout the 24-h day, with over half of patients with COPD experiencing 
symptoms in the morning, during the day, and at nighttime. Despite the 
prevalence of symptoms, patient and physician perception of the impact of COPD 
symptoms on patients' lives is not always in concordance. Dual bronchodilator 
therapy with a long-acting muscarinic antagonist (LAMA) and long-acting beta 
agonist (LABA) has the potential to treat the symptoms of COPD in addition to 
improving lung function. This review therefore examines the burden of symptoms 
experienced throughout the day by patients with COPD and the evidence for 
combined LAMA/LABA treatment in terms of symptom management. As patients with 
COPD experience varying symptoms throughout the course of their disease, the 
role of tailoring treatment to the individual needs of the patient is also 
examined. We conclude that the symptoms of COPD are troublesome, variable, can 
occur during all parts of the 24-h day, and have a substantial impact on 
patients' health status and quality of life. In order to provide effective, 
patient-orientated care, patients with COPD should be evaluated on the basis of 
lung function, the frequency of symptoms, and patient-perceived impact of 
symptoms on their lives. Therapy should be chosen carefully based on 
individualized assessment, ensuring personalization to the individual needs of 
the patient.

RATIONALE: Long-acting β-adrenergic agonists and long acting anticholinergic 
agents are recommended for the management of patients with stable chronic 
obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD); however, their role in the acute setting 
is uncertain.
OBJECTIVES: To describe the use and outcomes associated with long-acting 
bronchodilator therapy (LABD) among patients hospitalized with exacerbations of 
COPD.
METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohort study at 421 U.S. hospitals of 
patients hospitalized with exacerbations of COPD between January 1, 2010, and 
June 30, 2011. We used propensity score methods to compare the risk of a 
composite measure of treatment failure, length of stay, and hospital costs in 
patients who were treated with an LABD to those who did not receive treatment.
MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Of the 77,378 patients included in the analysis, 
31,725 (41%) were treated with an LABD on Hospital Day 1 or Day 2, including 
15,356 (48.4%) who received a long-acting β-agonist, 6,665 (21%) who received a 
long acting anticholinergic, and 9,704 (30.6%) who received both. When compared 
with patients who were not treated with an LABD, treated patients tended to be 
younger and had a modestly lower comorbidity burden but were more likely to have 
had prior admission for COPD and to be treated with inhaled corticosteroids. The 
incidence of treatment failure was similar among those who were or were not 
treated with LABDs (13.1 vs. 13.6%, P = 0.06). In propensity-matched analyses we 
found no difference in the risk of treatment failure associated with exposure to 
LABDs (relative risk [RR], 1.00; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.96-1.04), 
minimal differences in hospital cost (RR, 1.02; 95% CI, 1.01-1.03), and no 
difference in length of stay (RR, 1.01; 95% CI, 1.00-1.02).
CONCLUSIONS: Despite a lack of evidence, LABDs are commonly prescribed to 
patients hospitalized for exacerbations of COPD but are not associated with 
better clinical or economic outcomes. Clinical trials are needed to determine 
the optimal use of these medications in the acute care setting.

An important step in simplifying asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary 
disease (COPD) management and improving adherence with prescribed therapy is to 
reduce the dose frequency to the minimum necessary to maintain disease control. 
Therefore, the incorporation of once-daily dose administration is an important 
strategy to improve adherence and is a regimen preferred by most patients, which 
may also lead to enhancement of compliance, and may have advantages leading to 
improved overall clinical outcomes. Once-daily beta2-agonists or ultra 
long-acting beta2-agonists (LABAs) such as carmoterol, indacaterol, GSK-159797, 
GSK-597901, GSK-159802, GSK-642444 and GSK-678007 are under development for the 
treatment of asthma and COPD. Also some new long-acting antimuscarinic agents 
(LAMAs) such as aclidinium, LAS-35201, GSK656398, GSK233705, NVA-237 
(glycopyrrolate) and OrM3 are under development. In any case, the current 
opinion is that it will be advantageous to develop inhalers containing 
combination of several classes of long-acting bronchodilator drugs in an attempt 
to simplify treatment regimens as much as possible. Consequently, several 
options for once-daily dual-action ultra LABA+LAMA combination products are 
currently being evaluated. A different approach is to have a dimer molecule in 
which both pharmacologies are present (these molecules are known as M3 
antagonist-beta2 agonist (MABA) bronchodilators). The advent of a successful 
MABA product will revolutionize the field and open the door for a new range of 
combination products.

A review of current and developing fixed-dose LABA/LAMA combinations for 
treating COPD.

of South Carolina , Charleston , SC , USA.

The current GOLD (Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease) 
recommendations suggest using long acting β2 agonists (LABA) and long acting 
muscarinic antagonists (LAMA) in combination for group B COPD patients with 
persistent symptoms, group C COPD patients with further exacerbations on LAMA 
therapy alone and for group D COPD patients with or without combination with 
inhaled corticosteroids (ICS). Thus, there is a lot of interest in developing 
LABA/LAMA combinations for maintenance therapy of chronic stable COPD. Areas 
covered: Many LABA/LAMA combinations have successfully been approved through 
carefully designed pivotal clinical trials. The current clinical use of 
LABA/LAMA combinations in COPD will continue to evolve as new trials with and 
without inhaled corticosteroids are completed. Expert opinion: Combining 
different classes of bronchodilators in a single inhaler is an attractive 
concept that can potentially improve patient adherence to therapy. Because 
LABA/LAMA combinations are the preferred treatment option for preventing COPD 
exacerbations in the updated GOLD guidelines for COPD, they will be clinically 
used. Future treatment of COPD should revolve around a personalized approach 
based on characterization of the COPD phenotype.

INTRODUCTION: We studied the pattern changes over time of medication 
prescriptions for COPD and their conformity with French and international 
recommendations using data from patients in the prospective French cohort 
"Initiatives BPCO".
METHOD: Eight hundred and forty-six patients have been included during a first 
period from August, 2001 till May 2006 (n=425) and a second period from June, 
2006 till June, 2012 (n=421). The pivotal date was based on the tiotropium 
availability in France.
RESULTS: During period 1, we recruited older patients (average 65 vs 64 years), 
less often women (19 vs 26 %) and having less severe airflow obstruction (mean 
FEV1 48 vs 54 %). The ICS prescriptions decreased in mild COPD, but there was no 
change for inhaled long-acting beta-2 agonist (LABA) (68 %). The use of 
LABA+LAMA association without ICS increased from 0.9 to 7 %, but remained lower 
than the fixed LABA+ICS association (26 %), less often prescribed than the 
triple association LABA+ICS+LAMA (32.5 % in period 2). The use of long-acting 
bronchodilators increased from 68 to 80 % between both periods. Vaccinations and 
rehabilitation remained insufficiently prescribed. LAMA had been added but did 
not appear to replace other drugs.

INTRODUCTION: The aim of this study was to assess the degree of adherence for 
two standard regimens for administrating anticholinergic drugs (12 and 24 hours) 
in patients with chronic obstruction of the airflow and to establish whether the 
use of a once-daily dose improves the level of treatment adherence.
METHODS: We used long acting anticholinergics (LAMAs) as a study variable, and 
included the entire health area of Castile-La Mancha, numbering 2,100,998 
inhabitants, as the study population. We analyzed a total of 16,446 patients who 
had been prescribed a LAMA between January 1, 2013 and December 31, 2013. The 
follow-up period, based on a centralized system of electronic prescription 
management, was extended until December 2014.
RESULTS: During 2013, the medication collected was 7.4%-10.7% higher than 
indicated by labeling. This was very similar for all LAMAs, irrespective of the 
patient's sex, the molecule, the device, and the drug dosage. We did not observe 
seasonal variations in the consumption of LAMAs, nor did we detect differences 
between prescription drugs for once-daily (every 24 hours) versus twice-daily 
(every 12 hours) administration, between the different molecules, or between 
different types of inhalers for the same molecule. The results were similar in 
2014.
CONCLUSION: The principal conclusion of this study is that, in an area with a 
centralized management system of pharmacological prescriptions, adherence to 
treatment with LAMAs is very high, irrespective of the molecules or inhalation 
device. We did not find that patients who used twice-daily medication had a 
lower adherence.

Long-acting muscarinic antagonists for the prevention of exacerbations of 
chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.

Exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) have important 
consequences for lung function, health status and mortality. Furthermore, they 
are associated with high economic costs, predominantly related to 
hospitalization. They are managed acutely with short-acting bronchodilators, 
systemic corticosteroids or antibiotics; however, a large proportion of COPD 
exacerbations are unreported and therefore untreated or self-managed. There is 
evidence to suggest that these unreported exacerbations also have important 
consequences for health status; therefore, reducing exacerbation risk is an 
important goal in the management of COPD. Current guidelines recommend 
long-acting muscarinic antagonists (LAMAs) as first-line bronchodilator therapy 
in patients with stable COPD who have a high risk of exacerbation or increased 
symptoms. To date, three LAMAs, tiotropium bromide, aclidinium bromide and 
glycopyrronium bromide, have been approved as maintenance bronchodilator 
treatments for stable COPD. These all provide clinically significant 
improvements in lung function, reduce symptoms and improve health status 
compared with placebo in patients with COPD. This paper reviews evidence from 
randomized, controlled clinical trials demonstrating that tiotropium, aclidinium 
and glycopyrronium reduce exacerbation risk in patients with COPD. Reductions 
were seen irrespective of the exacerbation measure used, whether time to first 
event or annualized exacerbation rate. Furthermore, studies with aclidinium 
suggest LAMAs can reduce exacerbation risk irrespective of whether exacerbation 
events are assessed, using an event-based approach or a symptom-based method 
which includes unreported events. Together these results demonstrate that LAMAs 
have the potential to provide clinical benefit in the management of 
exacerbations in patients with stable COPD.

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a major cause of mortality 
worldwide, whose burden is expected to increase in the next decades, because of 
numerous risk factors, including the aging of the population. COPD is both 
preventable and treatable by an effective management including risk factor 
reduction, prevention, assessment, and treatment of acute exacerbations and 
co-morbidities. The available agents approved for COPD treatment are long-acting 
or ultra-long-acting β2-agonists (LABAs) and long-acting muscarinic antagonists 
(LAMAs) bronchodilators, as well as inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) in combination 
with LABAs. ICS use has been restricted only to selected COPD patients by the 
most recent documents, mainly based on the risk of exacerbations. However, 
several observational studies showed a high rate of prescription of ICS in COPD, 
irrespective of clinical recommendations, questioning the efficacy of these 
compounds in unselected patients with COPD and leading to possible increase risk 
of side effects related to ICS use. After examining the low levels of adherence 
in primary care and in the clinical settings to national and international 
recommendations for the treatment of COPD in different countries, the most 
common drivers of the prevailing use of ICS are critically reviewed here by 
examining their pros and cons, aimed at identifying evidence-based drivers for a 
proper selection of patients who may benefit from the proper use of ICS.

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the efficacy and safety of aclidinium bromide, a novel, 
long-acting inhaled muscarinic receptor antagonist approved by the Food and Drug 
Administration (FDA) in July 2012, as a treatment in the management of moderate 
to severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).
DATA SOURCES: Literature was identified through PubMed/MEDLINE (2000-March 2013) 
and International Pharmaceutical Abstracts using the search terms aclidinium, 
COPD, chronic bronchitis, emphysema, anticholinergic, and muscarinic antagonist. 
In addition, US government websites, including fda.gov and clinicaltrials.gov, 
were reviewed for pertinent information. Forest Laboratories, Inc provided 
previously unpublished clinical trial data. All reference citations from 
identified publications were reviewed for possible inclusion.
STUDY SELECTION AND DATA EXTRACTION: All identified Phase 1, 2a, 2b, and 3 
studies evaluating the safety and efficacy of aclidinium bromide were reviewed.
DATA SYNTHESIS: Once- and twice-daily aclidinium bromide was assessed for 
efficacy and safety in patients with moderate to severe COPD. In comparison to 
placebo, aclidinium significantly improves trough and peak forced expiratory 
volume in 1 second (FEV1). Significant increases in trough and peak FEV1 were 
sustainable for up to 64 weeks. In addition to improvement in trough and peak 
FEV1, twice-daily aclidinium 400 μg induced clinically meaningful improvements 
in the health status of patients with moderate to severe COPD. Aclidinium was 
generally well tolerated, with headache, cough, diarrhea, and nasopharyngitis 
the most common treatment-related adverse effects noted in clinical trials. 
Aclidinium did not demonstrate a difference in the incidence of systemic 
anticholinergic-associated adverse effects in comparison to placebo or active 
comparator.
CONCLUSIONS: Aclidinium bromide is a novel, inhaled, long acting anticholinergic 
that, when administered at the FDA-approved dose, safely produces clinically and 
statistically significant bronchodilation and improves health status in patients 
with moderate to severe COPD. Long-term clinical trials assessing the efficacy 
and safety of aclidinium are warranted.
