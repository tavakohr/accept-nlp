BACKGROUND: Maintenance treatment with long-acting beta2-agonists and inhaled 
corticosteroids (LABA/ICS) can relieve asthma symptoms and reduce the frequency 
of exacerbations, but there are limited treatment options for people who do not 
gain control on combination LABA/ICS. Long-acting muscarinic antagonists (LAMA) 
are a class of inhaled drug which have been effective for people with chronic 
obstructive pulmonary disease and are now becoming available for people with 
asthma to take alongside their LABA/ICS inhaler.
OBJECTIVES: To assess the effects of adding a long-acting muscarinic antagonist 
(LAMA) to combination long-acting beta2-agonists (LABA) and inhaled 
corticosteroids (ICS) in adults whose asthma is not well controlled by LABA/ICS.
SEARCH METHODS: We identified trials from the Cochrane Airways Review Group 
Specialised Register (CAGR) up to January 2016. We also searched 
ClinicalTrials.gov, the WHO trials portal, and reference lists of other reviews, 
and we contacted trial authors for additional information.
SELECTION CRITERIA: We included parallel randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of 
at least 12 weeks' duration. Studies met the inclusion criteria if they compared 
LAMA as an add-on to LABA/ICS versus LABA/ICS alone for adults with asthma. We 
included studies reported as full text, those published as abstract only, and 
unpublished data. Primary outcomes were exacerbations requiring oral 
corticosteroids (OCS), validated measures of asthma control, and serious adverse 
events (including mortality).
DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two review authors screened searches and 
independently extracted details on risk of bias and numerical data. We analysed 
dichotomous data as odds ratios (ORs) and continuous data as mean differences 
(MD) using a random-effects model. We rated all outcomes using GRADE.
MAIN RESULTS: We found four double-blind, double-dummy trials comparing LAMA to 
placebo, including 1197 people with asthma taking combination LABA/ICS. One of 
the trials was designed to study glycopyrronium bromide but was withdrawn prior 
to enrolment, and the other three all studied tiotropium bromide (mostly 5 µg 
once daily via Respimat) over 48 to 52 weeks. People in the trials had a mean 
forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) of 55% of their predicted value, 
indicating severe asthma.People randomised to take tiotropium add-on had fewer 
exacerbations requiring oral corticosteroids than those continuing to take 
LABA/ICS alone, but the confidence intervals did not rule out no difference (OR 
0.76, 95% CI 0.57 to 1.02; moderate quality evidence). Over 48 weeks, 328 out of 
1000 people taking their usual LABA/ICS would have to take oral corticosteroids 
for an exacerbation compared with 271 if they took tiotropium as well (95% CI 
218 to 333 per 1000). Analyses comparing the number of exacerbations per patient 
in each group (rate ratio) and the time until first exacerbation (hazard ratio) 
were in keeping with the main result. Quality of life, as measured by the Asthma 
Quality of Life Questionnaire (AQLQ) was no better for those taking tiotropium 
add-on than for those taking LABA/ICS alone when considered in light of the 0.5 
minimal clinically important difference on the scale (MD 0.09, 95% CI - 0.03 to 
0.20), and evidence for whether tiotropium increased or decreased serious 
adverse events in this population was inconsistent (OR 0.60, 95% CI 0.24 to 
1.47; I(2) = 76%).Within the secondary outcomes, exacerbations requiring 
hospital admission were too rare to tell whether tiotropium was beneficial over 
LABA/ICS alone. There was high quality evidence showing benefits to lung 
function (trough FEV1 and forced vital capacity (FVC)) and potentially small 
benefits to asthma control. People taking tiotropium add-on were less likely to 
experience non-serious adverse events.
AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Tiotropium add-on may have additional benefits over 
LABA/ICS alone in reducing the need for rescue oral steroids in people with 
severe asthma. The effect was imprecise, and there was no evidence for other 
LAMA preparations. Possible benefits on quality of life were negligible, and 
evidence for the effect on serious adverse events was inconsistent. There are 
likely to be small added benefits for tiotropium Respimat 5 µg daily on lung 
function and asthma control over LABA/ICS alone and fewer non-serious adverse 
events. The benefit of tiotropium add-on on the frequency of hospital admission 
is still unknown, despite year-long trials.Ongoing and future trials should 
clearly describe participants' background medications to help clinicians judge 
how the findings relate to stepwise care. If studies test LAMAs other than 
tiotropium Respimat for asthma, they should be at least six months long and use 
accepted and validated outcomes to allow comparisons of the safety and 
effectiveness between different preparations.

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a major cause of death and 
disability worldwide. Inhaled bronchodilators are the mainstay of COPD 
pharmacological treatment. Long-acting muscarinic antagonists (LAMAs) are a 
major class of inhaled bronchodilators. Some LAMA/device systems with different 
characteristics and dosing schedules are currently approved for maintenance 
therapy of COPD and a range of other products are being developed. They improve 
lung function and patient-reported outcomes and reduce acute bronchial 
exacerbations with good safety. LAMAs are used either alone or associated with 
long-acting β₂-agonists, eventually in fixed dose combinations. Long-acting 
β₂-agonist/LAMA combinations assure additional benefits over the individual 
components alone. The reader will obtain a view of the safety and efficacy of 
the different LAMA/device systems in COPD patients.

BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The aim of this study was to develop potent and 
long-acting antagonists of muscarinic ACh receptors. The 4-hexyloxy and 
4-butyloxy derivatives of 
1-[2-(4-oxidobenzoyloxy)ethyl]-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridin-1-ium were synthesized 
and tested for biological activity. Antagonists with long-residence time at 
receptors are therapeutic targets for the treatment of several neurological and 
psychiatric human diseases. Their long-acting effects allow for reduced daily 
doses and adverse effects.
EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH: The binding and antagonism of functional responses to the 
agonist carbachol mediated by 4-hexyloxy compounds were investigated in CHO 
cells expressing individual subtypes of muscarinic receptors and compared with 
4-butyloxy analogues.
KEY RESULTS: The 4-hexyloxy derivatives were found to bind muscarinic receptors 
with micromolar affinity and antagonized the functional response to carbachol 
with a potency ranging from 30 nM at M1 to 4 μM at M3 receptors. Under washing 
conditions to reverse antagonism, the half-life of their antagonistic action 
ranged from 1.7 h at M2 to 5 h at M5 receptors.
CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS: The 4-hexyloxy derivatives were found to be potent 
long-acting M1 -preferring antagonists. In view of current literature, M1 
-selective antagonists may have therapeutic potential for striatal cholinergic 
dystonia, delaying epileptic seizure after organophosphate intoxication or 
relieving depression. These compounds may also serve as a tool for research into 
cognitive deficits.

We performed a meta-analysis to compare the impact of triple combination therapy 
with inhaled corticosteroids (ICS), long-acting β2-agonists (LABAs) and 
long-acting muscarinic receptor antagonists (LAMAs) versus LABA/LAMA combination 
therapy or single long-acting bronchodilator therapy in chronic obstructive 
pulmonary disease. The ICS/LABA/LAMA combination reduced the risk of 
exacerbation (relative risk 0.70, 95% CI 0.53-0.94) and improved trough forced 
expiratory volume in 1 s (mean difference in mL +37.94, 95% CI 18.83-53.89) 
versus LABA/LAMA combination therapy. The protective effect of triple 
combination therapy versus LABA/LAMA combination therapy against risk of 
exacerbation was greater in patients with blood eosinophil counts 
≥300 cells·µL-1 (relative risk 0.57, 95% CI 0.48-0.68). While ∼38 patients had 
to be treated for 1 year with ICS/LABA/LAMA combination therapy to prevent one 
exacerbation compared to LABA/LAMA combination therapy, the number needed to 
treat (NNT) was ∼21 when compared to single long-acting bronchodilator therapy. 
The person-based NNT per year of ICS/LABA/LAMA combination therapy versus 
LABA/LAMA combination therapy was significantly (p<0.05) lower in patients with 
eosinophil counts ≥300 cells·µL-1 (NNT value: 8.58) than in those with counts 
<300 cells·µL-1 (NNT value: 46.28). The risk of pneumonia did not differ between 
ICS/LABA/LAMA combination therapy and its comparators. The number needed to harm 
was ∼195. This meta-analysis suggests that patients on single long-acting 
bronchodilator therapy or LABA/LAMA combination therapy, who still have 
exacerbations and have blood eosinophil counts ≥300 cells·µL-1, could benefit 
from ICS/LABA/LAMA combination therapy.

BACKGROUND: Revefenacin (TD-4208) is a potent, lung-selective, long-acting 
muscarinic antagonist currently in development as a once-daily nebulized therapy 
for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). We evaluated the 
pharmacodynamics (bronchodilator activity), pharmacokinetics (PK) and safety of 
single- and multiple-dose administrations of revefenacin in two clinical trials 
(Study 0059 and Study 0091) in patients with moderate to severe COPD.
METHODS: In Study 0059, 32 patients were randomized to receive a single dose of 
revefenacin (350 or 700 μg), active control ipratropium (500 μg) or placebo 
inhalation solution administered via standard jet nebulizer in a double-blind, 
crossover fashion. In Study 0091, 59 patients were randomized to receive 
once-daily inhalations of revefenacin (22, 44, 88, 175, 350 or 700 μg) or 
placebo for 7 days in a double-blind, incomplete block, five-way crossover 
design. The primary efficacy endpoint was change from baseline in peak (0-6 h) 
forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1) in Study 0059, and trough FEV1 after the 
final dose (Day 7) in Study 0091. In both studies, secondary endpoints included 
area under the FEV1-time curve (FEV1 AUC) values from time 12-24 h post dose and 
FEV1 AUC values from time zero to 24 h post dose.
RESULTS: Revefenacin demonstrated a rapid onset and sustained duration of 
bronchodilator action in both studies. In Study 0059, mean peak FEV1 was 
significantly higher (p < 0.001) for revefenacin and ipratropium compared to 
placebo, with differences of 176.8 mL for 350 μg revefenacin, 162.2 mL for 
700 μg revefenacin and 190.6 mL for ipratropium. In Study 0091, mean trough FEV1 
on Day 7 was significantly higher (p < 0.006) for all revefenacin doses compared 
to placebo, with differences ranging from 53.5 mL (22 μg dose) to 114.2 mL 
(175 μg dose). The results for the other spirometry endpoints were consistent 
with the primary endpoint for each study, demonstrating that the bronchodilator 
effect of revefenacin lasted more than 24 h following nebulized administration. 
Revefenacin was rapidly absorbed and extensively metabolized, followed by a slow 
apparent terminal elimination and minimal accumulation with repeated dosing. In 
both studies, adverse events were generally mild and occurred with similar 
frequencies in all groups, with no indication of significant systemic 
anti-muscarinic activity at any dose.
CONCLUSIONS: Following single or multiple nebulized-dose administration in 
patients with COPD, revefenacin demonstrates a rapid onset and sustained 
duration of bronchodilator effect over 24 h following once-daily administration, 
with a PK profile that is commensurate with low systemic exposure.

Decreasing the frequency and severity of exacerbations is one of the main goals 
of treatment for patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Several 
studies have documented that long-acting bronchodilators can reduce exacerbation 
rate and/or severity, and others have shown that combinations of long-acting 
β2-adrenergic agonists (LABAs) and long-acting muscarinic antagonists (LAMAs) 
provide greater reductions in exacerbation frequency than either their 
monocomponents or LABA/inhaled corticosteroid combinations in patients at low 
and high risk for these events. In this review, small groups of experts 
critically evaluated mechanisms potentially responsible for the increased 
benefit of LABA/LAMA combinations over single long-acting bronchodilators or 
LABA/inhaled corticosteroids in decreasing exacerbation. These included effects 
on lung hyperinflation and mechanical stress, inflammation, excessive mucus 
production with impaired mucociliary clearance, and symptom severity. The data 
assembled and analyzed by each group were reviewed by all authors and combined 
into this manuscript. Available clinical results support the possibility that 
effects of LABA/LAMA combinations on hyperinflation, mucociliary clearance, and 
symptom severity may all contribute to decreasing exacerbations. Although 
preclinical studies suggest LABAs and LAMAs have antiinflammatory effects, such 
effects have not been demonstrated yet in patients with chronic obstructive 
pulmonary disease.

Asthma is a complex disease where many patients remain symptomatic despite 
guideline-directed therapy. This suggests an unmet need for alternative 
treatment approaches. Understanding the physiological role of muscarinic 
receptors and the parasympathetic nervous system in the respiratory tract will 
provide a foundation of alternative therapeutics in asthma. Currently, several 
long-acting muscarinic antagonists (LAMAs) are on the market for the treatment 
of respiratory diseases. Many studies have shown the effectiveness of 
tiotropium, a LAMA, as add-on therapy in uncontrolled asthma. These studies led 
to FDA approval for tiotropium use in asthma. In this review, we discuss how the 
neurotransmitter acetylcholine itself contributes to inflammation, 
bronchoconstriction, and remodeling in asthma. We further describe the current 
clinical studies evaluating LAMAs in adult and adolescent patients with asthma, 
providing a comprehensive review of the current known physiological benefits of 
LAMAs in respiratory disease.

Evidence-based guidelines recommend inhaled long-acting anti-muscarinic agents 
(LAMAs) as first-line maintenance therapy for symptomatic patients with COPD. 
Several LAMAs are now available for use either as monotherapy or in combination 
with other COPD medications, including long-acting β2-agonists (LABAs) or 
inhaled corticosteroids (ICS). The efficacy and long-term safety of these 
medications have been evaluated in multiple clinical trials and real-life 
studies. This review evaluates the evidence available on the safety of existing 
LAMAs alone or in combination with LABAs and ICS in patients with COPD.

BACKGROUND: A large body of evidence suggests that long-acting β2-adrenoceptor 
agonist (LABA)/long-acting muscarinic antagonist (LAMA) combinations induce a 
strong synergistic bronchodilatory effect in human isolated airways. Moreover, a 
recent post hoc analysis demonstrated clinical synergism between LABAs and 
LAMAs, which induces a synergistic improvement not only in lung function but 
also in dyspnea in COPD patients.
AIM: The aim of this study is to examine the baseline factors related to 
improvement in lung function or clinical symptoms that results from the 
administration of LAMA or LAMA/LABA and to compare the differences in 
improvement in lung function or clinical symptoms between LAMA and LAMA/LABA.
METHODS: Among 829 patients with COPD who were treated with LAMA or LAMA/LABA in 
our hospital, 112 patients (aged 40-89 years) matched the criteria. Of these 112 
patients, 71 received LAMA (LAMA group) and 41 received LAMA/LABA (LAMA/LABA 
group) as the initial treatment. Various examination results such as lung 
function test values, symptom change, and frequency of exacerbations were 
compared between the two groups.
RESULTS: Compared with the monotherapy, the combination therapy significantly 
improved the FEV1, inspiratory capacity (IC), and total COPD assessment test 
(CAT) scores. Comparing the improvement in each domain of the CAT produced by 
the combination therapy with that of the monotherapy, larger improvements were 
found for the domains of going out and sleeping. The frequency of exacerbations 
during the 24 weeks was significantly lower in the combination therapy group 
than in the LAMA monotherapy group (P=0.034). Although no relationship was found 
between improvement in FEV1 and any pretreatment factors in the LAMA/LABA group, 
the improvement in the CAT score was strongly related to the baseline CAT score, 
smoking index, and air trapping index (P-value <1×10-4).
CONCLUSION: In this study of clinical practice, we found that LAMA/LABA 
combination therapy improved the clinical symptoms of COPD and IC and that the 
effects of the combination therapy were consistent with those observed in 
previous clinical trials.

BACKGROUND: Cystic fibrosis is a life-limiting inherited condition which affects 
one in 2500 newborns in the UK and 70,000 children and adults worldwide. The 
condition is multifaceted and affects many systems in the body. The respiratory 
system is particularly affected due to a build up of thickened secretions and a 
predisposition to infection. Inhaled bronchodilators are prescribed for 80% of 
people with cystic fibrosis in order to widen the airways and alleviate 
symptoms. Both short- and long-acting inhaled bronchodilators are used to 
improve respiratory symptoms. Short-acting inhaled bronchodilators take effect 
in minutes and typically last for four to eight hours (muscarinic antagonists). 
Long-acting inhaled bronchodilators also take effect within minutes but 
typically last for around 12 hours and sometimes longer. This review is one of 
two which are replacing a previously published review of both long- and 
short-acting inhaled bronchodilators.
OBJECTIVES: This review aims to evaluate long-acting inhaled bronchodilators in 
children and adults with cystic fibrosis in terms of clinical outcomes and 
safety. If possible, we aimed to assess the optimal drug and dosage regimen.
SEARCH METHODS: We searched the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis Trials Register, 
compiled from electronic database searches and handsearching of journals and 
conference abstract books.Date of last search: 10 October 2017.We also carried 
out a separate search of Embase and the reference lists of included trials. We 
searched clinical trials registries for any ongoing trials and made contact with 
pharmaceutical companies for any further trials.Date of Embase search: 11 
October 2017.
SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised or quasi-randomised parallel trials comparing 
long-acting inhaled bronchodilators (beta-2 agonists and muscarinic antagonists) 
with placebo, no treatment or a different long-acting inhaled bronchodilator in 
adults and children with cystic fibrosis.
DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Both authors independently assessed trials for 
inclusion (based on title, abstract and full text). The authors independently 
assessed the included trials for quality and risk of bias and extracted data. 
Discrepancies were resolved by a third party.
MAIN RESULTS: The searches identified 195 unique references, of which 155 were 
excluded on title and abstract. We assessed the full texts of the remaining 
references, excluded 16 trials (28 references) and included four trials (12 
references) in the review with 1082 participants.One trial (n = 16) measuring 
the effect of beta-2 agonists reported an improvement in forced expiratory 
volume at one second (FEV1) after treatment (at one month), but the trial was 
small with an unclear risk of bias so we judged the evidence to be very low 
quality. The trial did not report on participant-reported outcomes, quality of 
life or adverse events.Three trials (n = 1066) looked at the effects of the 
muscarinic antagonist tiotropium at doses of 2.5 µg and 5.0 µg in both the short 
term (up to 28 days) and the longer term (up to three months). Only one of the 
trials reported the change in FEV1 (L) after 28 days treatment and showed no 
significant difference between groups; with 2.5 µg tiotropium, mean difference 
(MD) -0.02 (95% confidence interval (CI) -0.13 to 0.09), or 5.0 µg tiotropium, 
MD 0.00 (95% CI -0.10 to 0.10) (moderate-quality evidence). All three trials of 
muscarinic antagonists provided data on adverse events which were found to 
differ little from placebo at doses of 2.5 µg, risk ratio (RR) 1.01 (95% CI 0.92 
to 1.11) or 5.0 µg, RR 0.98 (95% CI 0.90 to 1.06). Very little 
participant-reported outcome data or quality of life data were available for 
analysis. Two of the trials were at low risk of bias overall whilst the 
remaining trial was at an unclear risk overall.
AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Neither long-acting beta-2 agonists nor long-acting 
muscarinic antagonist bronchodilators demonstrate improvement in our primary 
outcome of FEV1. No difference was observed between intervention and placebo in 
terms of quality of life or adverse events. The quality of evidence for the use 
of beta-2 agonists was very low. The use of a long-acting inhaled bronchodilator 
may help to reduce the burden of treatment for people with cystic fibrosis as it 
is taken less often than a short-acting inhaled bronchodilator, but future 
trials would benefit from looking at the effects on our primary outcomes 
(spirometric changes from baseline, quality of life and adverse effects) in the 
longer term.

Several long-acting bronchodilators have been developed and are widely used as 
first-line treatment in patients with stable chronic obstructive pulmonary 
disease (COPD). However, the initial choice of therapy is still uncertain. The 
aim of this study was to examine the clinical efficacy and safety of long-acting 
muscarinic antagonist (LAMA) and long-acting beta2-agonist (LABA) in patients 
with stable COPD. We searched several databases and manufacturers' websites to 
identify relevant randomized clinical trials for meta-analysis. Outcomes of 
interest were trough forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1 ), acute 
exacerbations, transitional dyspnoea index (TDI) score, St George's Respiratory 
Questionnaire (SGRQ) score and adverse events. Sixteen trials with a total of 
22 872 patients were included in this study. Compared with LABA, LAMA were 
associated with a greater reduction in acute exacerbations (OR: 0.84, 95% CI: 
0.74-0.94, P = 0.003) and fewer adverse events (OR: 0.92, 95% CI: 0.86-0.97, 
P = 0.005). There were no significant differences in trough FEV1 , TDI and SGRQ 
scores. In patients with stable COPD, LAMA were associated with a greater 
reduction in acute exacerbations and fewer adverse effects compared with LABA.

Asthma is a chronic inflammatory disorder of the airways that is a major global 
burden on both individuals and healthcare systems. Despite guideline-directed 
treatment, a significant proportion of patients with asthma do not achieve 
control. This review focuses on the potential use of long-acting 
anticholinergics as bronchodilators in the treatment of asthma, with results 
published from clinical trials of glycopyrrolate, umeclidinium and tiotropium. 
The tiotropium clinical trial programme is the most advanced, with data 
available from a number of phase II and III studies of tiotropium as an add-on 
to inhaled corticosteroid maintenance therapy, with or without a long-acting 
β2-agonist, in patients across asthma severities. Recent studies using the 
Respimat Soft Mist inhaler have identified 5 µg once daily as the preferred 
dosing regimen, which has shown promising results in adults, adolescents and 
children with asthma. Tiotropium Respimat has recently been incorporated into 
the Global Initiative for Asthma 2015 treatment strategy as a recommended 
alternative therapy at steps 4 and 5 in adult patients with a history of 
exacerbations. The increasing availability of evidence from ongoing and future 
clinical trials will be beneficial in determining where long-acting 
anticholinergic agents fit in future treatment guidelines across a variety of 
patient populations and disease severities.

OBJECTIVE: To determine whether long-acting muscarinic antagonists (LAMAs) 
provide superior therapeutic effects over long-acting β2 agonists (LABAs) for 
preventing COPD exacerbations.
METHODS: This was a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized clinical 
trials involving patients with stable, moderate to severe COPD according to the 
Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease criteria, treated with a 
LAMA (i.e., tiotropium bromide, aclidinium, or glycopyrronium), followed for at 
least 12 weeks and compared with controls using a LABA in isolation or in 
combination with a corticosteroid.
RESULTS: A total of 2,622 studies were analyzed for possible inclusion on the 
basis of their title and abstract; 9 studies (17,120 participants) were included 
in the analysis. In comparison with LABAs, LAMAs led to a greater decrease in 
the exacerbation rate ratio (relative risk [RR] = 0.88; 95% CI: 0.84-0.93]; a 
lower proportion of patients who experienced at least one exacerbation (RR = 
0.90; 95% CI: 0.87-0.94; p < 0.00001); a lower risk of exacerbation-related 
hospitalizations (RR = 0.78; 95% CI: 0.69-0.87; p < 0.0001); and a lower number 
of serious adverse events (RR = 0.81; 95% CI: 0.67-0.96; p = 0.0002). The 
overall quality of evidence was moderate for all outcomes.
CONCLUSIONS: The major findings of this systematic review and meta-analysis were 
that LAMAs significantly reduced the exacerbation rate (exacerbation 
episodes/year), as well as the number of exacerbation episodes, of 
hospitalizations, and of serious adverse events.

OBJETIVO: Determinar se long-acting muscarinic antagonists (LAMAs, antagonistas 
muscarínicos de longa duração) são superiores a long-acting β2 agonists (LABAs, 
β2-agonistas de longa duração) na prevenção de exacerbações da DPOC.
MÉTODOS: Revisão sistemática e meta-análise de ensaios clínicos controlados 
aleatórios com pacientes com DPOC estável, de moderada a grave, conforme os 
critérios da Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease, tratados 
com LAMA (brometo de tiotrópio, aclidínio ou glicopirrônio), acompanhados 
durante pelo menos 12 semanas e comparados a controles que usaram LABA 
isoladamente ou com um corticosteroide.
RESULTADOS: Foram analisados 2.622 estudos para possível inclusão com base em 
seu título e resumo; 9 estudos (17.120 participantes) foram incluídos na 
análise. Em comparação com LABAs, LAMAs resultaram em maior diminuição da razão 
da taxa de exacerbações [risco relativo (RR) = 0,88; IC95%: 0,84-0,93]; menor 
proporção de pacientes que apresentaram pelo menos uma exacerbação (RR = 0,90; 
IC95%: 0,87-0,94; p < 0,00001); menor risco de hospitalizações em virtude de 
exacerbação da doença (RR = 0,78; IC95%: 0,69-0,87; p < 0,0001) e menor número 
de eventos adversos sérios (RR = 0,81; IC95%: 0,67-0,96; p = 0,0002). A 
qualidade geral das evidências foi moderada para todos os desfechos.
CONCLUSÕES: O principal achado desta revisão sistemática e meta-análise foi que 
LAMAs reduziram significativamente a taxa de exacerbações (episódios de 
exacerbação/ano), os episódios de exacerbação, as hospitalizações e os eventos 
adversos sérios.

OBJECTIVE: To compare the safety and effectiveness of long-acting β-antagonists 
(LABA), long-acting antimuscarinic agents (LAMA) and inhaled corticosteroids 
(ICS) for managing chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).
SETTING: Systematic review and network meta-analysis (NMA).
PARTICIPANTS: 208 randomised clinical trials (RCTs) including 134,692 adults 
with COPD.
INTERVENTIONS: LABA, LAMA and/or ICS, alone or in combination, versus each other 
or placebo.
PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOMES: The proportion of patients with 
moderate-to-severe exacerbations. The number of patients experiencing mortality, 
pneumonia, serious arrhythmia and cardiovascular-related mortality (CVM) were 
secondary outcomes.
RESULTS: NMA was conducted including 20 RCTs for moderate-to-severe 
exacerbations for 26,141 patients with an exacerbation in the past year. 32 
treatments were effective versus placebo including: tiotropium, 
budesonide/formoterol, salmeterol, indacaterol, fluticasone/salmeterol, 
indacaterol/glycopyrronium, tiotropium/fluticasone/salmeterol and 
tiotropium/budesonide/formoterol. Tiotropium/budesonide/formoterol was most 
effective (99.2% probability of being the most effective according to the 
Surface Under the Cumulative RAnking (SUCRA) curve). NMA was conducted on 
mortality (88 RCTs, 97 526 patients); fluticasone/salmeterol was more effective 
in reducing mortality than placebo, formoterol and fluticasone alone, and was 
the most effective (SUCRA=71%). NMA was conducted on CVM (37 RCTs, 55,156 
patients) and the following were safest: salmeterol versus each OF placebo, 
tiotropium and tiotropium (Soft Mist Inhaler (SMR)); fluticasone versus 
tiotropium (SMR); and salmeterol/fluticasone versus tiotropium and tiotropium 
(SMR). Triamcinolone acetonide was the most harmful (SUCRA=81%). NMA was 
conducted on pneumonia occurrence (54 RCTs, 61 551 patients). 24 treatments were 
more harmful, including 2 that increased risk of pneumonia versus placebo; 
fluticasone and fluticasone/salmeterol. The most harmful agent was 
fluticasone/salmeterol (SUCRA=89%). NMA was conducted for arrhythmia; no 
statistically significant differences between agents were identified.
CONCLUSIONS: Many inhaled agents are available for COPD, some are safer and more 
effective than others. Our results can be used by patients and physicians to 
tailor administration of these agents.

Parasympathetic activity is increased in patients with chronic obstructive 
pulmonary disease (COPD) and asthma and appears to be the major reversible 
component of airway obstruction. Therefore, treatment with muscarinic receptor 
antagonists is an effective bronchodilator therapy in COPD and also in asthmatic 
patients. In recent years, the accumulating evidence that the cholinergic system 
controls not only contraction by airway smooth muscle but also the functions of 
inflammatory cells and airway epithelial cells has suggested that muscarinic 
receptor antagonists could exert other effects that may be of clinical relevance 
when we must treat a patient suffering from COPD or asthma. There are currently 
six muscarinic receptor antagonists licenced for use in the treatment of COPD, 
the short-acting muscarinic receptor antagonists (SAMAs) ipratropium bromide and 
oxitropium bromide and the long-acting muscarinic receptor antagonists (LAMAs) 
aclidinium bromide, tiotropium bromide, glycopyrronium bromide and umeclidinium 
bromide. Concerns have been raised about possible associations of muscarinic 
receptor antagonists with cardiovascular safety, but the most advanced compounds 
seem to have an improved safety profile. Further beneficial effects of SAMAs and 
LAMAs are seen when added to existing treatments, including LABAs, inhaled 
corticosteroids and phosphodiesterase 4 inhibitors. The importance of tiotropium 
bromide in the maintenance treatment of COPD, and likely in asthma, has spurred 
further research to identify new LAMAs. There are a number of molecules that are 
being identified, but only few have reached the clinical development.

The purpose of this study was to systematically review the efficacy and safety 
of long-acting β-agonist/long-acting muscarinic antagonist (LABA/LAMA) and 
LABA/inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) combinations in patients with advanced chronic 
obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Randomized clinical trials of at least 
12 weeks of duration comparing LABA/LAMA and LABA/ICS combinations were 
included. We chose forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1), St. George's 
Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ) score, Transitional Dyspnea Index (TDI), COPD 
Assessment Test (CAT) score, COPD exacerbations, mortality, and other safety 
parameters as outcome assessment criteria. We included six randomized controlled 
trials with a total of 4,319 patients. Most patients did not have a history of 
exacerbation. LABA/LAMA was associated with greater improvement in FEV1 than 
LABA/ICS (mean difference (MD) 0.09L, 95%confidence interval (CI) 0.07 to 0.11L; 
high certainty). Two treatments appeared clinically equivalent in improving SGRQ 
(MD -0.12, 95%CI -1.16 to 0.92; high certainty), TDI (MD 0.15, 95%CI -0.05 to 
0.35; high certainty), and CAT scores (MD 0.28 95%CI -0.29 to 0.85; moderate 
certainty). LABA/LAMA was associated with an absolute reduction of approximately 
8% in the incidence of pneumonia compared with LABA/ICS (risk ratio 0.41, 95%CI 
0.18 to 0.94; moderate certainty). There was no significant difference in safety 
and exacerbation outcomes. However, equivalence of two treatments could not be 
concluded due to imprecision especially for mortality, cardiac serious adverse 
events, and severe exacerbations. Our findings support the use of dual 
long-acting bronchodilators for patients with advanced COPD but without frequent 
exacerbations given the excess risk of pneumonia with LABA/ICS.

Long-acting muscarinic antagonists for the prevention of exacerbations of 
chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.

Exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) have important 
consequences for lung function, health status and mortality. Furthermore, they 
are associated with high economic costs, predominantly related to 
hospitalization. They are managed acutely with short-acting bronchodilators, 
systemic corticosteroids or antibiotics; however, a large proportion of COPD 
exacerbations are unreported and therefore untreated or self-managed. There is 
evidence to suggest that these unreported exacerbations also have important 
consequences for health status; therefore, reducing exacerbation risk is an 
important goal in the management of COPD. Current guidelines recommend 
long-acting muscarinic antagonists (LAMAs) as first-line bronchodilator therapy 
in patients with stable COPD who have a high risk of exacerbation or increased 
symptoms. To date, three LAMAs, tiotropium bromide, aclidinium bromide and 
glycopyrronium bromide, have been approved as maintenance bronchodilator 
treatments for stable COPD. These all provide clinically significant 
improvements in lung function, reduce symptoms and improve health status 
compared with placebo in patients with COPD. This paper reviews evidence from 
randomized, controlled clinical trials demonstrating that tiotropium, aclidinium 
and glycopyrronium reduce exacerbation risk in patients with COPD. Reductions 
were seen irrespective of the exacerbation measure used, whether time to first 
event or annualized exacerbation rate. Furthermore, studies with aclidinium 
suggest LAMAs can reduce exacerbation risk irrespective of whether exacerbation 
events are assessed, using an event-based approach or a symptom-based method 
which includes unreported events. Together these results demonstrate that LAMAs 
have the potential to provide clinical benefit in the management of 
exacerbations in patients with stable COPD.

Long acting muscarinic receptor antagonists (LAMA) reverse airflow obstruction 
by antagonizing para-sympathetic bronchoconstricting effects within the airways. 
For years, tiotropium, has been the cornerstone LAMA for chronic obstructive 
pulmonary disease (COPD) management. Recently, new agents, aclidinium bromide, 
glycopyrronium bromide, and umeclidinium bromide, have been developed and 
introduced into clinical practice. Areas covered: This article reviews the 
clinical efficacy and adverse effects of currently available LAMAs in COPD 
treatment as well as developing LAMAs in early clinical trials and preclinical 
studies (V0162, TD-4208, CHF 5407, AZD9164, AZD8683, bencycloquidium). In 
addition, a new class of molecule that combines muscarinic antagonist and 
β2-adrenergic properties (MABA) is described and current developmental progress 
discussed (GSK-961081, THRX-200495). Expert opinion: Future key areas for 
developing drugs for the management of COPD include prolonged duration of 
action, optimal delivery systems, synergistic combinations with other drugs, 
maximization of benefits and minimization of adverse effects. The development of 
new LAMA and MABA molecules provides exciting progress towards simpler and more 
effective COPD management.

IMPORTANCE: There are 30 million adults (12%) in the United States who have 
chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Chronic obstructive pulmonary 
disease accounts for 3.2% of all physician office visits annually and is the 
fourth leading cause of death (126 000 deaths per year). Most patients are 
diagnosed by their primary care clinicians who must address the highly variable 
clinical features and responses to therapy. The diagnosis and treatment of COPD 
is rapidly changing, so understanding recent advances is important for the 
delivery of optimal patient care.
OBSERVATIONS: Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease is characterized by 
incompletely reversible expiratory airflow limitation. Spirometry is the 
reference standard for diagnosing and assessing the severity of COPD. All 
patients should be counseled about and receive preventive measures such as 
smoking cessation and vaccination. Treatment should be guided by the severity of 
lung impairment, symptoms such as dyspnea, the amount of cough and sputum 
production, and how often a patient experiences an exacerbation. When dyspnea 
limits activity or quality of life, COPD should be treated with once- or 
twice-daily maintenance long-acting anticholinergic and β-agonist 
bronchodilators. Patients with acute exacerbations may benefit from the addition 
of inhaled corticosteroids, particularly those with elevated peripheral 
eosinophil levels. Pulmonary rehabilitation, which includes strength and 
endurance training and educational, nutritional, and psychosocial support, 
improves symptoms and exercise tolerance but is underutilized. Supplemental 
oxygen for patients with resting hypoxemia (defined as Spo2 <89%) improves 
survival.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease is a 
complicated disease requiring intensive treatment. Appropriate use of 
long-acting maintenance bronchodilators, inhaled corticosteroids, and pulmonary 
rehabilitation decreases symptoms, optimizes functional performance, and reduces 
exacerbation frequency. Supplemental oxygen in patients with resting hypoxemia 
prolongs life, and other advanced treatments are available based on specific 
patient characteristics.

Long-Acting β-Agonists (LABA) Combined With Long-Acting Muscarinic Antagonists 
or LABA Combined With Inhaled Corticosteroids for Patients With Stable COPD.

Medicine, Yokohama, Japan.

CLINICAL QUESTION: Are inhaled long-acting muscarinic antagonists (LAMA) 
combined with long-acting β-agonists (LABA) associated with differences in the 
incidence of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) exacerbation and 
serious adverse events and with differences in quality of life and forced 
expiratory volume in the first second of expiration (FEV1) vs inhaled LABA plus 
inhaled corticosteroids therapy for the treatment of stable COPD?
BOTTOM LINE: Compared with inhaled LABA combined with corticosteroids, inhaled 
LAMA combined with LABA may be associated with a lower risk of COPD exacerbation 
and with greater improvement in FEV1 without differences in the incidence of 
serious severe adverse events or quality of life.
