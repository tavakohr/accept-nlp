BACKGROUND: Airway viral infections cause the exacerbations of asthma and 
chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. PD-L1, also known as B7-H1, is an 
immune-checkpoint molecule that plays a role in an escape mechanism of viruses 
from the host immune systems. This escape may be associated with the persistence 
of viral infection and the exacerbation of the underlying diseases. In a study 
in vitro, we have shown that corticosteroids plus Long acting beta 2 agonists 
(LABAs) attenuate the upregulation of PD-L1 on airway epithelial cells 
stimulated with an analog of viral double-stranded RNA, 
polyinosinic-polycytidylic acid (poly I:C). To address its biological relevance 
in vivo, we investigated the effect of corticosteroid plus LABA on the 
expression of PD-L1 in double-stranded RNA-induced lung inflammation in mice.
METHODS: Mice were intratracheally administered with poly I:C. The expression of 
PD-L1 on the lung cells was assessed by flow cytometry and inflammation was 
assessed for bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF). Independent as well as 
combination effects of ciclesonide and indacaterol were examined.
RESULTS: Administration of low dose poly I:C upregulated the expression of 
PD-L1, induced neutrophilia and increased keratinocyte-derived chemokine (KC), 
macrophage inflammatory protein-1beta (MIP-1beta), and IL-6 in BALF. The upregulation 
of PD-L1, neutrophilic inflammation and increase of KC were suppressed by 
ciclesonide plus indacaterol, but not by either when administered independently. 
Although the upregulation of PD-L1 by high dose poly I:C was suppressed by 
ciclesonide plus indacaterol, neutrophilia and increased KC, MIP-1beta, and IL-6 in 
BALF were not attenuated.
CONCLUSIONS: Ciclesonide plus indacaterol attenuate double-stranded RNA-induced 
upregulation of PD-L1 in the lungs.

History suggests beta agonists, the cognate ligand of the beta2 adrenoceptor, have 
been used as bronchodilators for around 5,000 years, and beta agonists remain today 
the frontline treatment for asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease 
(COPD). The beta agonists used clinically today are the products of significant 
expenditure and over 100 year's intensive research aimed at minimizing side 
effects and enhancing therapeutic usefulness. The respiratory physician now has 
a therapeutic toolbox of long acting beta agonists to prophylactically manage 
bronchoconstriction, and short acting beta agonists to relieve acute exacerbations. 
Despite constituting the cornerstone of asthma and COPD therapy, these drugs are 
not perfect; significant safety issues have led to a black box warning advising 
that long acting beta agonists should not be used alone in patients with asthma. In 
addition there are a significant proportion of patients whose asthma remains 
uncontrolled. In this chapter we discuss the evolution of beta agonist use and how 
the understanding of beta agonist actions on their principal target tissue, airway 
smooth muscle, has led to greater understanding of how these drugs can be 
further modified and improved in the future. Research into the genetics of the 
beta2 adrenoceptor will also be discussed, as will the implications of individual 
DNA profiles on the clinical outcomes of beta agonist use (pharmacogenetics). 
Finally we comment on what the future may hold for the use of beta agonists in 
respiratory disease.

BACKGROUND: Long-acting bronchodilators comprising long-acting beta(2)-agonists 
and the anticholinergic agent tiotropium are commonly used for managing 
persistent symptoms of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Combining these 
treatments, which have different mechanisms of action, may be more effective 
than the individual components. However, the benefits and risks of combining 
tiotropium and long-acting beta(2)-agonists for the treatment of chronic 
obstructive pulmonary (COPD) disease are unclear.
OBJECTIVES: To assess the relative effects of treatment with tiotropium in 
addition to long-acting beta(2)-agonist compared to tiotropium or long-acting 
beta(2)-agonist alone in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
SEARCH METHODS: We searched the Cochrane Airways Group Specialised Register of 
trials and clinicaltrials.gov up to January 2012.
SELECTION CRITERIA: We included parallel group, randomised controlled trials of 
three months or longer comparing treatment with tiotropium in addition to 
long-acting beta(2)-agonist against tiotropium or long-acting beta(2)-agonist 
alone for patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two review authors independently assessed trials 
for inclusion and then extracted data on trial quality and the outcome results. 
We contacted study authors for additional information. We collected information 
on adverse effects from the trials.
MAIN RESULTS: Five trials were included in this review, mostly recruiting 
participants with moderate or severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. All 
of them compared tiotropium in addition to long-acting beta(2)-agonist to 
tiotropium alone, but only one trial additionally compared a combination of the 
two types of bronchodilator with long-acting beta(2)-agonist (formoterol) alone. 
Two studies used the long-acting beta(2)-agonist indacaterol, two used 
formoterol and one used salmeterol.Compared to tiotropium alone (3263 patients), 
treatment with tiotropium plus long-acting beta(2)-agonist resulted in a 
slightly larger improvement in the mean health-related quality of life (St 
George's Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ) MD -1.61; 95% CI -2.93 to -0.29). In 
the control arm, tiotropium alone, the SGRQ improved by falling 4.5 units from 
baseline and with both treatments the improvement was a fall of 6.1 units from 
baseline (on average). High withdrawal rates in the trials increased the 
uncertainty in this result, and the GRADE assessment for this outcome was 
therefore moderate. There were no significant differences in the other primary 
outcomes (hospital admission or mortality).The secondary outcome of 
pre-bronchodilator FEV(1) showed a small mean increase with the addition of 
long-acting beta(2)-agonist (MD 0.07 L; 95% CI 0.05 to 0.09) over the control 
arm, which showed a change from baseline ranging from 0.03 L to 0.13 L on 
tiotropium alone. None of the other secondary outcomes (exacerbations, symptom 
scores, serious adverse events, and withdrawals) showed any statistically 
significant differences between the groups. There were wide confidence intervals 
around these outcomes and moderate heterogeneity for both exacerbations and 
withdrawals.The results from the one trial comparing the combination of 
tiotropium and long-acting beta(2)-agonist to long-acting beta(2)-agonist alone 
(417 participants) were insufficient to draw firm conclusions for this 
comparison.
AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: The results from this review indicate a small mean 
improvement in health-related quality of life for patients on a combination of 
tiotropium and long-acting beta(2)-agonist compared to tiotropium alone, but it 
is not clear how clinically important this mean difference may be. Hospital 
admission and mortality have not been shown to be altered by adding long-acting 
beta(2)-agonists to tiotropium. There were not enough data to determine the 
relative efficacy and safety of tiotropium plus long-acting beta(2)-agonist 
compared to long-acting beta(2)-agonist alone. There were insufficient data to 
make comparisons between the different long-acting beta(2)-agonists when used in 
addition to tiotropium.

Medicine , Houston , TX , USA.

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), characterized by persistent and 
partially reversible airflow obstruction, is a leading cause of morbidity and 
mortality worldwide. Long-acting inhaled bronchodilators form the backbone for 
the maintenance therapy for this disease. The ultra-Long acting beta 2 agonists 
(ultra-LABAs) represent novel pharmacologic agents with interesting potential 
benefits as stand-alone therapy or in combination with other therapies for the 
treatment of COPD. Areas covered: In this review, we will focus newly developed 
ultra-LABAs, describing currently available evidence of their clinical effect 
and safety, their comparison relative to older Long acting beta 2 agonists, and 
their potential niche in the maintenance treatment of COPD. We also provide an 
overview of the current landscape of available LABAs, and discuss the present 
understanding of the disease, and suggest possible future directions for COPD 
therapy. Expert opinion: Ultra-LABAs are pivotal bronchodilators in the 
maintenance therapy of COPD as monotherapy or in combination with other agents. 
Their long-acting effect permits once daily dosing and their improved delivery 
using novel devices and their safety profile represent an important advancement 
in management of this disease.

The Global Initiative for Asthma (GINA) annual report summarizes the latest 
evidence for asthma management. GINA recommends stepwise pharmacological 
treatment, advocating inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) plus rapid, long-acting 
beta2-agonists (LABA) delivered in a single inhaler for maintenance and relief at 
Steps 3 (moderate persistent asthma requiring 1-2 controllers plus as-needed 
reliever), 4 (severe persistent asthma requiring â‰¥2 controllers plus as-needed 
reliever), and 5 (higher level care and/or add-on treatment). Areas covered: 
Randomized controlled trials and real-world evidence demonstrate that flexibly 
dosed budesonide/formoterol for maintenance and relief (SymbicortÂ® Maintenance 
And Reliever Therapy [SMART]) is associated with reductions in severe 
exacerbations, prolongs time to first exacerbation, and provides fast symptom 
relief. Expert commentary: SMART provides greater or equal levels of sustained 
asthma control than similar or higher fixed doses of ICS/LABA plus short-acting 
beta2-agonist (SABA) as needed or higher ICS plus SABA as needed, with lower 
overall ICS doses and cost. The simplified dosing strategy may improve adherence 
and overall asthma control but relies on patient education. 
Budesonide/formoterol as needed in mild asthma (patients qualifying for regular 
low-dose ICS) is currently under investigation in two double-blind randomized 
studies, SYGMA1/2 (NCT02149199/NCT02224157), comparing budesonide/formoterol as 
needed with budesonide plus SABA and SABA alone.

Indacaterol. A long-acting beta-2 agonist, no advantages in COPD.

[No authors listed]

In patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), bronchodilator 
drugs have only modest symptomatic efficacy. There is no evidence that they slow 
disease progression. A short-acting beta-2 agonist such as salbutamol is the 
first-choice treatment, used either on demand or on a regular basis. Long-acting 
beta2 agonists are an option for patients with nocturnal symptoms. Indacaterol 
is a long-acting beta-2 agonist that is inhaled once a day. Indacaterol has not 
been compared with a short-acting beta-2 agonist. Clinical evaluation is based 
on 4 double-blind randomised placebo-controlled trials, 3 of which also included 
a group treated with another long-acting bronchodilator (formoterol, salmeterol 
or tiotropium. The symptomatic efficacy of indacaterol was only modest, and 
similar to that of other long-acting bronchodilators. Indacaterol has the known 
adverse effect profile of beta-2 agonists. Some adverse effects seem to be more 
frequent than with other long-acting bronchodilators, including post-inhalation 
cough, hyperglycaemia, respiratory tract infections, and possibly cardiac 
disorders. There is no evidence that once-daily inhalation has any advantages 
over twice-daily inhalation, even in terms of convenience. In addition, as 
efficacy is limited, there is a risk that patients will use the drug more 
frequently, resulting in additional adverse effects. The nebulizer used to 
inhale the powder in the capsules is similar to the one provided with Foradil 
(formoterol. In practice, indacaterol offers no therapeutic advantage over 
existing treatments for patients with COPD. It is better to use the 
best-documented drugs and, if necessary, to add non-drug measures. Eliminating 
exposure to toxic agents, especially tobacco smoke, remains the only treatment 
with a proven benefit on the course of COPD.

OBJECTIVE: To compare the available literature regarding the use of long-acting 
muscarinic antagonist (LAMA)/Long acting beta 2 agonists (LABA) and inhaled 
corticosteroid (ICS)/LABA combination inhaler therapy in chronic obstructive 
pulmonary disease (COPD) maintenance therapy management.
DATA SOURCES: A MEDLINE literature search from database inception to February 
2017 was conducted using the search terms chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, 
adrenergic beta-agonist, muscarinic antagonist, and inhaled corticosteroid. 
References from extracted sources were further searched for any relevant, missed 
data sources.
STUDY SELECTION AND DATA EXTRACTION: All English-language randomized-controlled 
trials comparing LAMA/LABA and ICS/LABA combination inhaler therapy were 
evaluated.
DATA SYNTHESIS: A total of 10 randomized controlled trials have reviewed the use 
of LAMA/LABA compared with ICS/LABA therapy for COPD maintenance therapy. 
Results of clinical trials that evaluated LAMA/LABA and ICS/LABA maintenance 
therapy demonstrated superior improvements in pulmonary function tests via 
spirometry and improved clinical outcomes with LAMA/LABA therapy, specifically 
reduction in COPD exacerbation rates. The safety of LAMA/LABA combination 
therapy also is favorable compared with ICS/LABA combination therapy because of 
the increased infection risk with ICS therapy.
CONCLUSIONS: COPD is a disease state with significant morbidity and mortality in 
the United States and is the third leading cause of death. Long-acting inhalers 
are recommended for the majority of COPD severities, and combination therapy is 
typically utilized. LAMA/LABA combination therapy has demonstrated superior 
improvements in pulmonary function and reduction in COPD exacerbation rates 
compared with ICS/LABA. LAMA/LABA combination therapy will have a larger future 
role in COPD maintenance management.

RATIONALE: Post hoc analyses suggest that blood eosinophils have potential as a 
predictive biomarker of inhaled corticosteroid efficacy in the management of 
chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).
OBJECTIVES: We prospectively investigated the value of blood eosinophils as a 
predictor of responsiveness to an inhaled corticosteroid/Long acting beta 2-agonist 
combination versus a Long acting beta 2-agonist/long-acting muscarinic antagonist 
combination for exacerbation prevention.
METHODS: We conducted prespecified analyses of data from the FLAME (Effect of 
Indacaterol Glycopyronium vs Fluticasone Salmeterol on COPD Exacerbations) 
study, which compared once-daily Long acting beta 2-agonist/long-acting muscarinic 
antagonist indacaterol/glycopyrronium 110/50 Î¼g with twice-daily long-acting 
beta2-agonist/inhaled corticosteroid salmeterol/fluticasone combination 50/500 Î¼g 
in patients with one or more exacerbations in the preceding year. Subsequent 
post hoc analyses were conducted to address further cutoffs and endpoints.
MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: We compared treatment efficacy according to blood 
eosinophil percentage (<2% and â‰¥2%, <3% and â‰¥3%, and <5% and â‰¥5%) and absolute 
blood eosinophil count (<150 cells/Î¼l, 150 to <300 cells/Î¼l, and â‰¥300 cells/Î¼l). 
Indacaterol/glycopyrronium was significantly superior to salmeterol/fluticasone 
for the prevention of exacerbations (all severities, or moderate or severe) in 
the <2%, â‰¥2%, <3%, <5%, and <150 cells/Î¼l subgroups, and at no cutoff was 
salmeterol/fluticasone superior to indacaterol/glycopyrronium. Furthermore, the 
rate of moderate or severe exacerbations did not increase with increasing blood 
eosinophils. The incidence of pneumonia was higher in patients receiving 
salmeterol/fluticasone than indacaterol/glycopyrronium in both the <2% and â‰¥2% 
subgroups.
CONCLUSIONS: Our prospective analyses indicate that indacaterol/glycopyrronium 
provides superior or similar benefits over salmeterol/fluticasone regardless of 
blood eosinophil levels in patients with COPD. Clinical trial registered with 
www.clinicaltrials.gov (NCT01782326).

BACKGROUND: The long-acting bronchodilator tiotropium and single inhaler 
combination therapy of inhaled corticosteroids and long-acting beta(2)-agonists 
are both commonly used for maintenance treatment of chronic obstructive 
pulmonary disease. Combining these treatments, which have different mechanisms 
of action, may be more effective than the individual components. However, the 
benefits and risks of using tiotropium and combination therapy together for the 
treatment of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease are unclear.
OBJECTIVES: To assess the relative effects of inhaled corticosteroid and 
long-acting beta(2)-agonist combination therapy in addition to tiotropium 
compared to tiotropium or combination therapy alone in patients with chronic 
obstructive pulmonary disease.
SEARCH STRATEGY: We searched the Cochrane Airways Group Specialised Register of 
trials (July 2010) and reference lists of articles.
SELECTION CRITERIA: We included parallel, randomised controlled trials of three 
months or longer, comparing inhaled corticosteroid and long-acting 
beta(2)-agonists combination therapy in addition to inhaled tiotropium against 
tiotropium alone or combination therapy alone.
DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: We independently assessed trials for inclusion and 
then extracted data on trial quality and outcome results. We contacted study 
authors for additional information. We collected information on adverse effects 
from the trials.
MAIN RESULTS: Three trials (1021 patients) were included comparing tiotropium in 
addition to inhaled corticosteroid and long-acting beta(2)-agonist combination 
therapy to tiotropium alone. The duration, type of combination treatment and 
definition of outcomes varied. The limited data led to wide confidence intervals 
and there was no significant statistical difference in mortality, participants 
with one or more hospitalisations, episodes of pneumonia or adverse events. The 
results on exacerbations were heterogeneous and were not combined. The mean 
health-related quality of life and lung function were significantly different 
when combination therapy was added to tiotropium, although the size of the 
average benefits of additional combination therapy were small, St George's 
Respiratory Questionnaire (MD -2.49; 95% CI -4.04 to -0.94) and forced 
expiratory volume in one second (MD 0.06 L; 95% CI 0.04 to 0.08).One trial (60 
patients) compared tiotropium plus combination therapy to combination therapy 
alone. The results from the trial were insufficient to draw firm conclusions for 
this comparison.
AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: To date there is uncertainty regarding the long-term 
benefits and risks of treatment with tiotropium in addition to inhaled 
corticosteroid and long-acting beta(2)-agonist combination therapy on mortality, 
hospitalisation, exacerbations of COPD and pneumonia. The addition of 
combination treatment to tiotropium has shown improvements in average 
health-related quality of life and lung function.

INTRODUCTION: Several dual bronchodilator fixed-dose inhaler medications were 
recently approved for the treatment of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease 
(COPD). These products combine a Long acting beta 2 -agonist (LABA) and long-acting 
muscarinic antagonist (LAMA). In clinical trials, the separate mechanisms of the 
bronchodilators resulted in improved lung function. COPD treatment guidelines 
currently recommend combination LABA/LAMA as alternative therapy to combination 
LABA/inhaled corticosteroid (ICS). Evidence is limited on the comparative 
effectiveness of LABA/LAMA and LABA/ICS in COPD. The objective of this study was 
to compare real-world COPD exacerbation rates among patients treated with 
LABA/LAMA with those treated with LABA/ICS.
METHODS: This was a retrospective observational study of COPD patients in the 
United States treated with LABA/LAMA or LABA/ICS combination. Insurance claims 
from January 1, 2004, through December 31, 2014, were used as the data source. 
Patients were required to have greater than one prescription filled for the 
combination medications, and they were followed from 30Â days after drug 
initiation. Individuals were censored if they discontinued a study medication, 
initiated medication from the opposite cohort (LAMA or ICS), lost enrollment 
eligibility, or at the study period end. Exacerbation rates were compared using 
Poisson regression.
RESULTS: There were 5384 patients in the LABA/LAMA cohort and 473,388 patients 
in the LABA/ICS cohort. The LABA/LAMA cohort was older, had more comorbidities, 
and more severe COPD. Unadjusted annual exacerbation rates were 2.87 events per 
person-year (standard deviation [SD] 5.14) in the LABA/LAMA cohort and 1.68 (SD 
9.82) in the LABA/ICS cohort. The adjusted incidence rate ratio was 0.98 (95% 
confidence interval 0.95-1.01) for LABA/LAMA compared with LABA/ICS.
CONCLUSIONS: The LABA/LAMA combination had similar effectiveness to LABA/ICS as 
measured by exacerbation rates in COPD patients. As a result, characteristics 
other than effectiveness, such as symptom control, cost, patient preferences, 
and adverse events, may be important in selecting between the two regimens.

INTRODUCTION: The treatment of COPD (Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease) aims 
to improve the patients's well-being and to reduce mortality, morbidity and the 
development of exacerbations. This study was thus designed to compare the 
efficacy and tolerability of salmeterol/fluticasone combination with tiotropium 
in patients with moderate COPD.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: This was an open, prospective, randomized trial in COPD 
patients whose FEV1 (forced expiratory volume in 1 second) levels were between 
80% and 50% predicted. A total of 44 patients who met the inclusion and exlusion 
criteria and who gave written informed consent were included in the study. At 
the end of the two week wash-out period, the patients were randomized to receive 
either salmeterol 50 Âµg/fluticasone 500 Âµg combination as dry powder inhaler 
twice daily (SF Group) or tiotropium dry powder inhaler 18 Âµg once daily (T 
Group) for one year. These were equally distributed in the two groups (22 
patients in each study group). At follow-up, the patients were required to come 
to the outpatient clinic at the third, sixth, ninth and twelfth months.
RESULT: There were no statistically significant difference between the two 
groups with regards to demographic features and baseline measurements. There 
were 1.2 Â± 1.7 exacerbations in SF Group and 2.1 Â± 2.2 exacerbations in T Group 
(p= 0.070). The time to the first exacerbation was 4.2 Â± 4.0 and 4.2 Â± 3.3 
months, respectively (p= 0.697). The number of severe exacerbations that 
resulted in admission to the emergency department or hospital was 0.6 Â± 1.0 and 
1.1 Â± 1.4, respectively (p= 0.245). Significant improvements were observed in 
CAT (CPOD Assessment Test) scores in both groups during the treatment period (p< 
0.0001); but there was no difference between the two groups.
CONCLUSIONS: This study has shown that in patients with moderate COPD, treatment 
with combined corticosteroid and long-acting beta-2 agonist provides similar 
improvements in pulmonary function tests, patient-reported outcomes and exercise 
capacity as compared a long-acting anticholinergics.

This study describes the association rate and residence time of abediterol, a 
novel Long acting beta 2-adrenoceptor agonist (LABA) in Phase II development for 
treatment of asthma and COPD, in comparison with indacaterol, olodaterol, 
vilanterol and salmeterol, for both human beta1- and beta2-adrenoceptors. Abediterol 
association and dissociation rates were monitored directly by using its 
tritiated form. Moreover, association was determined indirectly using 
experimental Ki and koff obtained from assays performed with unlabelled 
compound. Dissociation was also studied indirectly by measuring the association 
rate of 3H-CGP12177 to beta adrenoceptors previously occupied by unlabelled 
compounds. Abediterol shows a fast association for the beta2-adrenoceptor (kon 1.4 
Ã— 107 Â± 1.8 Ã— 106M-1min-1) while its dissociation rate is between 30 and 64 
times slower than that of the reference LABA compounds tested, with a residence 
time of 91.3 Â± 13.3min (measured directly) and 185.5 Â± 7.5min (measured 
indirectly). Abediterol shows kinetic selectivity for the beta2- over the 
beta1-adrenoceptor, with a dissociation rate from the beta1-adrenoceptor similar to 
the other LABA compounds tested. In conclusion, abediterol is a potent LABA with 
a fast association rate and a long residence time at beta2-adrenoceptors. These 
data are in agreement with the onset and duration of action of abediterol shown 
in humans.

BACKGROUND: Long acting beta 2-adrenoceptor agonists have been shown to increase the 
risk of atrial arrhythmias in patients with stable chronic obstructive pulmonary 
disease. The aim of this study was to investigate whether perioperative 
Long acting beta 2-adrenoceptor agonists treatment would increase the risk of 
postoperative atrial arrhythmias after lung cancer surgery in chronic 
obstructive pulmonary disease patients.
METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed 174 consecutive chronic obstructive 
pulmonary disease patients with non-small-cell lung cancer who underwent 
lobectomy or segmentectomy. The subjects were divided into those with or without 
perioperative Long acting beta 2-adrenoceptor agonists treatment. Postoperative 
cardiopulmonary complications were compared between the two groups.
RESULTS: There were no statistically significant differences between the 
perioperative Long acting beta 2-adrenoceptor agonists treatment group and the 
control group in the incidence of postoperative atrial arrhythmias (Pâ€‰=â€‰0.629). 
In 134 propensity-score-matched pairs, including variables such as age, gender, 
comorbidities, smoking history, operation procedure, lung-cancer staging, and 
respiratory function, there were no significant differences between the two 
groups in the incidence of postoperative cardiopulmonary complications, 
including atrial arrhythmias.
CONCLUSIONS: Perioperative administration of Long acting beta 2-adrenoceptor 
agonists might not increase the incidence of postoperative atrial arrhythmias 
after surgical resection for non-small-cell lung cancer in chronic obstructive 
pulmonary disease patients.

Long-acting muscarinic antagonistâ€‰+â€‰long-acting beta agonist versus long-acting 
beta agonistâ€‰+â€‰inhaled corticosteroid for COPD: A systematic review and 
meta-analysis.

Some trials have been conducted to compare long-acting muscarinic antagonist 
(LAMA)â€‰+â€‰long-acting beta agonist (LABA) versus LABAâ€‰+â€‰inhaled corticosteroids 
(ICS) for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), but no meta-analysis 
were reported. Two investigators independently searched for eligible articles 
using the PubMed, Web of Science and Cochrane databases. Articles in authors' 
reference files were also regarded as candidates. The eligibility criteria for 
the current meta-analysis were original trials written in English comparing the 
impact of LAMAâ€‰+â€‰LABA and LABAâ€‰+â€‰ICS for COPD patients. A pooled value for the 
continuous value was calculated using the genetic inverse variance method for 
mean difference. Incidence of events was evaluated using the odds ratio (OR). 
Minimal clinically important difference were 50â€‰mL for forced expiratory volume 
in 1 s (FEV1 ), four points for St George Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ) and 
one point for transition dyspnoea index (TDI). We included seven randomized 
controlled trials and one cross-over trial with follow-up period of 6-26 weeks. 
Compared with LABAâ€‰+â€‰ICS, LAMAâ€‰+â€‰LABA led to significantly greater improvements 
of trough FEV1 by 71 (95% CI: 48-95) mL, TDI by 0.38 points (95% CI: 0.17-0.58), 
less exacerbations with an OR of 0.77 (95% CI: 0.62-0.96) and less pneumonia 
with an OR of 0.28 (95% CI: 0.12-0.68). Frequencies of any adverse event, 
serious adverse event, adverse event leading to discontinuation, all-cause death 
and change of total score of SGRQ were not different in both arms. LAMAâ€‰+â€‰LABA 
might be a better option for treating COPD than LABAâ€‰+â€‰ICS.

[Fixed Combination of a Long-Acting beta(2)-Agonist and an Inhaled Steroid. A 
Therapeutic Option for COPD?].

BACKGROUND: The introduction of long-acting bronchodilators (beta(2)-agonists 
and anticholinergics) has essentially changed the therapy of chronic obstructive 
pulmonary disease (COPD) in the last years. Furthermore, the understanding of 
the pathophysiology of the disease has improved, leading to a reevaluation of 
essential therapeutic principles. Especially, the significance of inhaled 
steroids in elder and sicker patients is now being acknowledged.
COMBINED TREATMENT OF COPD: For a long time, the use of the fixed combination of 
an inhaled steroid and a long-acting beta(2)-agonist seemed to be reserved for 
the therapy of bronchial asthma, as there was clinical as well as pharmacologic 
evidence of a synergism of the therapy components, i. e., increase in 
beta(2)-receptor density and responsiveness by the steroid and activation of the 
glucocorticoid receptor by the beta(2)-agonist. However, first studies in COPD 
showed significant, clinically relevant improvement of the classic outcome 
parameter pulmonary function as well as of symptoms, especially dyspnea, quality 
of life and incidence of severe exacerbations, exceeding solely additive effects 
of the monosubstances.
CONCLUSION: According to clinical data, the supposed synergism is very likely, 
even though pharmacodynamic evidence is not yet available. However, the 
beneficial effect of combination therapy could be demonstrated for older 
patients with more severe disease (FEV(1) < 50%, history of frequent 
exacerbations) only. Further studies will be needed to clarify, if other patient 
groups will benefit from this therapy option and which dosage is to be regarded 
as optimal.

Salmeterol: a novel, long-acting beta 2-agonist.

Meyer JM(1), Wenzel CL, Kradjan WA.

OBJECTIVE: The clinical pharmacology, pharmacokinetics, clinical efficacy, and 
adverse effects of the long-acting beta 2-agonist salmeterol are reviewed.
DATA SOURCES: A MEDLINE search was performed to identify English-language 
publications pertaining to salmeterol.
STUDY SELECTION: Open and controlled trials were reviewed in assessing clinical 
efficacy. Only the results of controlled, randomized trials were considered in 
the effectiveness evaluation.
DATA EXTRACTION: The primary measures of effectiveness in the clinical trials 
were bronchodilator activity and reduction of hyperresponsiveness that may 
reflect antiinflammatory activity. Bronchodilator activity was measured as 
changes in pulmonary function; reduction of hyperresponsiveness was evaluated 
using respiratory challenge with methacholine, histamine, allergen, or cold air. 
Secondary measures included symptom scores, need for rescue doses, and patient 
preference.
DATA SYNTHESIS: Salmeterol is a selective, beta 2-agonist that has been studied 
in the treatment of exercise-induced, nocturnal, and allergen-induced asthma. 
Salmeterol interacts with the traditional beta-receptor in a similar manner as 
other beta-agonists, and it exhibits potent in vitro antiinflammatory effects as 
an inhibitor of inflammatory mediator release. Less evidence exists for its in 
vivo antiinflammatory activity. Salmeterol demonstrates prolonged receptor 
occupancy, which is thought to contribute to its long duration of action. The 
recommended dose is 50 micrograms via metered-dose inhaler or dry-powdered 
inhalation. In the published clinical trials, salmeterol was more effective than 
albuterol in treating asthma, including exercise and allergen-induced asthma. 
Salmeterol's major advantage over other inhaled beta-agonists is its long 
duration of action (12 hours), making it an excellent choice for treatment of 
nocturnal asthma. A potential disadvantage is delayed onset of action. 
Tachyphylaxis to salmeterol's bronchodilator effects has not been shown, but 
tolerance to its protective effects against methacholine-induced 
bronchoconstriction has occurred. Adverse effects reported have been mild and 
have included headache, tremor, and palpitations.
CONCLUSIONS: Salmeterol is an effective beta 2-agonist in the treatment of 
asthma. However, several issues require further investigation regarding its 
long-term effects on disease control, significance of antiinflammatory activity, 
and role as a rescue medication.

BACKGROUND: Stepping down therapy when asthma is well controlled on combination 
inhaled corticosteroids (ICSs) and long-acting beta-agonists (LABAs) is 
recommended, but it is not known whether lowering the ICS dose or stopping LABA 
is superior.
OBJECTIVE: To evaluate whether step-down therapy with LABA is superior to one 
without; and, secondarily, to evaluate whether reducing the ICS dose while 
maintaining LABA is noninferior to remaining on stable-ICS/LABA.
METHODS: The study was a randomized, double-masked 3-arm parallel group trial in 
participants aged 12 years or older. Following an 8-week run-in, 459 
participants were randomly assigned to continue medium-dose ICS/LABA, 
reduced-dose ICS/LABA, or ICS alone (LABA-step-off) and followed for 48 weeks. 
The primary outcome was time to treatment failure, a composite of health care 
utilization, systemic corticosteroid use, increase in rescue therapy, decline in 
lung function, or participant or physician decision.
RESULTS: Time to treatment failure did not differ significantly between reduced- 
ICS/LABA and LABA-step-off (hazard ratio, 1.07; 95.3% CI, 0.69-1.65, PÂ = .76). 
Nor was there a difference between stable-ICS/LABA and reduced-ICS/LABA (hazard 
ratio, 1.11; 95% CI, 0.70-1.76; PÂ = .67), but the 10% noninferiority margin was 
exceeded. Lung function declines and hospitalization rates were significantly 
greater in the LABA-step-off group.
CONCLUSIONS: The 2 step-down regimens did not differ in terms of treatment 
failure, although stopping LABA was associated with a decline in lung function 
and more hospitalizations. There was no evidence to support the noninferiority 
of reduced-ICS/LABA as compared with stable-ICS/LABA.

Airway subsensitivity with long-acting beta 2-agonists. Is there cause for 
concern?

Lipworth BJ(1).

Author information:

Dundee, Scotland.

Regular treatment with both long- and short-acting beta 2-agonists results in 
tolerance to their bronchoprotective effects, although the relevance of this 
phenomenon in terms of long term asthma control remains unclear. However, there 
appears to be no appreciable difference between the 2 long-active beta 
2-agonists, salmeterol and formoterol, in their propensity to induce beta 
2-adrenoceptor down-regulation and subsensitivity. The degree of subsensitivity 
appears to be somewhat greater with indirect stimuli such as exercise and 
allergen challenge, compared with direct stimuli such as histamine and 
methacholine. This loss of functional antagonism with long-acting beta 2-agonist 
therapy is partial and is not prevented by concomitant inhaled corticosteroid 
therapy. However, the protective effects of inhaled corticosteroids on their own 
appear to be additive to those of long-acting beta 2-agonists when both drugs 
are concomitantly administered in the long term. The subsensitivity to 
bronchoprotection may be of clinical relevance in terms of patients who are 
inadvertently exposed to indirect bronchoconstrictor stimuli such as allergens 
or exercise, suggesting that long-acting beta 2-agonists should not be taken on 
a regular basis for this particular indication. There is a greater tendency for 
bronchodilator subsensitivity to develop with longer-acting, than with 
shorter-acting beta 2-agonists, and this may reflect the longer duration of beta 
2-adrenoceptor occupancy and consequent downregulation. As with the 
bronchoprotective effects of long-acting beta 2-agonists, the development of 
bronchodilator subsensitivity is only partial and occurs regardless of whether 
patients are taking concomitant inhaled corticosteroid therapy. The long-term 
bronchodilator action of the long-acting beta 2-agonist itself is maintained 
within the twice daily administration interval. However, subsensitivity occurs 
in relation to a blunted response to repeated doses of short-acting beta 
2-agonists, as in the setting of an acute asthma attack. There is considerable 
inter-individual variability in the propensity for downregulation and 
subsensitivity, which is determined by genetic polymorphism of the beta 
2-adrenoceptor. Current international asthma management guidelines suggest that 
long-acting beta 2-agonists should be used on a regular basis in patients who 
ware inadequately controlled on inhaled corticosteroid therapy, so the addition 
of long-acting beta 2-agonist therapy is an alternative to using higher doses of 
inhaled corticosteroids. There are, however, concerns that regular long-acting 
beta 2-agonists might result in masking of inadequately treated inflammation in 
patients receiving suboptimal inhaled corticosteroid therapy. Physicians should 
be aware of the airway subsensitivity that develops with long-acting beta 
2-agonist therapy, and patients should be warned that they may have to use 
higher than conventional dosages of short-acting beta 2-agonists to relieve 
acute bronchoconstriction in order to overcome this effect. In patients 
receiving an optimised maintenance dose of inhaled corticosteroid, if 
long-acting beta 2-agonists are to be used on an as required basis, it would 
seem rational to use formoterol for this purpose, due to its faster onset of 
action than salmeterol.

Inhaled corticosteroids are the preferred primary long-term treatment for 
asthma. The first option in patients who are uncontrolled with inhaled steroids 
is adding long-acting beta-2 agonists. The addition of a long-acting 
beta-agonist to an inhaled corticosteroid has been accepted as effective therapy 
for almost two decades Despite the widespread use and their clinical benefit, 
controversy regarding their safety arose after their introduction. Concerns 
about the safety of long-acting beta-2 agonist therapy, has led to the 
appearance of multiple publications and recommendations. The evidence supports 
the use of long-acting beta-2 agonists plus inhaled corticosteroids in a single 
inhaler device to increase adherence and reduce the potential use of long-acting 
beta-2 agonists monotherapy. This review examines and commands on the available 
clinical data and safety concerns of long-acting beta-2 agonists use in patients 
with asthma.

Therapeutic approaches of asthma and COPD overlap.

Asthma and COPD overlap (ACO) is an important clinical phenotype, due to the 
low-health-related quality of life (QOL), rapid decline in lung function, 
frequent exacerbation, and high economic burden. However, no large-scaled 
therapeutic trials of ACO have been conducted. At present, ACO is treated 
according to asthma/COPD guidelines. The goals of ACO treatment are to relieve 
symptoms and improve QOL and lung functions. Treatment must also prevent disease 
progression, airway remodeling, exacerbation, complications, and comorbidities. 
To achieve these goals, ACO needs first to be assessed based on 
pathophysiological findings. Comprehensive long-term management includes 
medication, reduction of risk factors, environmental improvement, patient 
education, rehabilitation, and vaccination. Drug treatment for ACO employs a 
combination of inhaled corticosteroids (ICSs) and long-acting bronchodilators; 
long-acting muscarinic antagonists and/or Long acting beta 2 agonists. The dose of 
ICS is determined according to ACO severity. Leukotriene receptor antagonists 
and theophylline are used as add-on drugs. Macrolides and expectorants are 
recommended for reduction of mucus hypersecretion. Anti-IgE and anti-IL-5 
antibodies, oral corticosteroids, and oxygen therapy are additional treatments 
for the most severe ACO. The therapeutic effects are evaluated using lung 
function tests, eosinophil counts in sputum and blood, FeNO, and symptom 
questionnaires. ACO exacerbation is treated by inhalation of short-acting 
beta2-agonist and systemic corticosteroids. The doses of corticosteroids are 
determined based on the asthma/COPD component of the exacerbation. 
Administration of antibiotics is recommended if sputum is purulent. Referral to 
specialists is necessary in cases of inability to control symptoms by 
medication, uncertain diagnosis with atypical features, or severe complications 
and comorbidities.
