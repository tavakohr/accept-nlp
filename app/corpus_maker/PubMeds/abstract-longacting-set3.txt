Long-acting β2-agonists (LABAs) such as formoterol and salmeterol are used for 
prolonged bronchodilatation in asthma, usually in combination with inhaled 
corticosteroids (ICSs). Unexplained paradoxical asthma exacerbations and deaths 
have been associated with LABAs, particularly when used without ICS. LABAs 
clearly demonstrate effective bronchodilatation and steroid-sparing activity, 
but long-term treatment can lead to tolerance of their bronchodilator effects. 
There are also concerns with regard to the effects of LABAs on bronchial 
hyperresponsiveness (BHR), where long-term use is associated with increased BHR 
and loss of bronchoprotection. A complicating factor is that formoterol and 
salmeterol are both chiral compounds, usually administered as 50:50 racemic 
(rac-) mixtures of two enantiomers. The chiral nature of these compounds has 
been largely forgotten in the debate regarding LABA safety and effects on BHR, 
particularly that (S)-enantiomers of β2-agonists may be deleterious to asthma 
control. LABAs display enantioselective pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics. 
Biological plausibility of the deleterious effects of β2-agonists 
(S)-enantiomers is provided by in vitro and in vivo studies from the 
short-acting β2-agonist (SABA) salbutamol. Supportive clinical findings include 
the fact that patients in emergency departments who demonstrate a blunted 
response to salbutamol are more likely to benefit from (R)-salbutamol than 
rac-salbutamol, and resistance to salbutamol appears to be a contributory 
mechanism in rapid asthma deaths. More effort should therefore be applied to 
investigating potential enantiospecific effects of LABAs on safety, specifically 
bronchoprotection. Safety studies directly assessing the effects of LABA 
(S)-enantiomers on BHR are long overdue.

BACKGROUND: Stepping down therapy when asthma is well controlled on combination 
inhaled corticosteroids (ICSs) and long acting beta agonists (LABAs) is 
recommended, but it is not known whether lowering the ICS dose or stopping LABA 
is superior.
OBJECTIVE: To evaluate whether step-down therapy with LABA is superior to one 
without; and, secondarily, to evaluate whether reducing the ICS dose while 
maintaining LABA is noninferior to remaining on stable-ICS/LABA.
METHODS: The study was a randomized, double-masked 3-arm parallel group trial in 
participants aged 12 years or older. Following an 8-week run-in, 459 
participants were randomly assigned to continue medium-dose ICS/LABA, 
reduced-dose ICS/LABA, or ICS alone (LABA-step-off) and followed for 48 weeks. 
The primary outcome was time to treatment failure, a composite of health care 
utilization, systemic corticosteroid use, increase in rescue therapy, decline in 
lung function, or participant or physician decision.
RESULTS: Time to treatment failure did not differ significantly between reduced- 
ICS/LABA and LABA-step-off (hazard ratio, 1.07; 95.3% CI, 0.69-1.65, P = .76). 
Nor was there a difference between stable-ICS/LABA and reduced-ICS/LABA (hazard 
ratio, 1.11; 95% CI, 0.70-1.76; P = .67), but the 10% noninferiority margin was 
exceeded. Lung function declines and hospitalization rates were significantly 
greater in the LABA-step-off group.
CONCLUSIONS: The 2 step-down regimens did not differ in terms of treatment 
failure, although stopping LABA was associated with a decline in lung function 
and more hospitalizations. There was no evidence to support the noninferiority 
of reduced-ICS/LABA as compared with stable-ICS/LABA.

History suggests β agonists, the cognate ligand of the β2 adrenoceptor, have 
been used as bronchodilators for around 5,000 years, and β agonists remain today 
the frontline treatment for asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease 
(COPD). The β agonists used clinically today are the products of significant 
expenditure and over 100 year's intensive research aimed at minimizing side 
effects and enhancing therapeutic usefulness. The respiratory physician now has 
a therapeutic toolbox of long acting β agonists to prophylactically manage 
bronchoconstriction, and short acting β agonists to relieve acute exacerbations. 
Despite constituting the cornerstone of asthma and COPD therapy, these drugs are 
not perfect; significant safety issues have led to a black box warning advising 
that long acting β agonists should not be used alone in patients with asthma. In 
addition there are a significant proportion of patients whose asthma remains 
uncontrolled. In this chapter we discuss the evolution of β agonist use and how 
the understanding of β agonist actions on their principal target tissue, airway 
smooth muscle, has led to greater understanding of how these drugs can be 
further modified and improved in the future. Research into the genetics of the 
β2 adrenoceptor will also be discussed, as will the implications of individual 
DNA profiles on the clinical outcomes of β agonist use (pharmacogenetics). 
Finally we comment on what the future may hold for the use of β agonists in 
respiratory disease.

Some trials have been conducted to compare long-acting muscarinic antagonist 
(LAMA) + long-acting beta agonist (LABA) versus LABA + inhaled corticosteroids 
(ICS) for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), but no meta-analysis 
were reported. Two investigators independently searched for eligible articles 
using the PubMed, Web of Science and Cochrane databases. Articles in authors' 
reference files were also regarded as candidates. The eligibility criteria for 
the current meta-analysis were original trials written in English comparing the 
impact of LAMA + LABA and LABA + ICS for COPD patients. A pooled value for the 
continuous value was calculated using the genetic inverse variance method for 
mean difference. Incidence of events was evaluated using the odds ratio (OR). 
Minimal clinically important difference were 50 mL for forced expiratory volume 
in 1 s (FEV1 ), four points for St George Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ) and 
one point for transition dyspnoea index (TDI). We included seven randomized 
controlled trials and one cross-over trial with follow-up period of 6-26 weeks. 
Compared with LABA + ICS, LAMA + LABA led to significantly greater improvements 
of trough FEV1 by 71 (95% CI: 48-95) mL, TDI by 0.38 points (95% CI: 0.17-0.58), 
less exacerbations with an OR of 0.77 (95% CI: 0.62-0.96) and less pneumonia 
with an OR of 0.28 (95% CI: 0.12-0.68). Frequencies of any adverse event, 
serious adverse event, adverse event leading to discontinuation, all-cause death 
and change of total score of SGRQ were not different in both arms. LAMA + LABA 
might be a better option for treating COPD than LABA + ICS.

or long-acting beta(2)-agonist alone for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.

BACKGROUND: Long-acting bronchodilators comprising long-acting beta(2)-agonists 
and the anticholinergic agent tiotropium are commonly used for managing 
persistent symptoms of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Combining these 
treatments, which have different mechanisms of action, may be more effective 
than the individual components. However, the benefits and risks of combining 
tiotropium and long-acting beta(2)-agonists for the treatment of chronic 
obstructive pulmonary (COPD) disease are unclear.
OBJECTIVES: To assess the relative effects of treatment with tiotropium in 
addition to long-acting beta(2)-agonist compared to tiotropium or long-acting 
beta(2)-agonist alone in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
SEARCH METHODS: We searched the Cochrane Airways Group Specialised Register of 
trials and clinicaltrials.gov up to January 2012.
SELECTION CRITERIA: We included parallel group, randomised controlled trials of 
three months or longer comparing treatment with tiotropium in addition to 
long-acting beta(2)-agonist against tiotropium or long-acting beta(2)-agonist 
alone for patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two review authors independently assessed trials 
for inclusion and then extracted data on trial quality and the outcome results. 
We contacted study authors for additional information. We collected information 
on adverse effects from the trials.
MAIN RESULTS: Five trials were included in this review, mostly recruiting 
participants with moderate or severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. All 
of them compared tiotropium in addition to long-acting beta(2)-agonist to 
tiotropium alone, but only one trial additionally compared a combination of the 
two types of bronchodilator with long-acting beta(2)-agonist (formoterol) alone. 
Two studies used the long-acting beta(2)-agonist indacaterol, two used 
formoterol and one used salmeterol.Compared to tiotropium alone (3263 patients), 
treatment with tiotropium plus long-acting beta(2)-agonist resulted in a 
slightly larger improvement in the mean health-related quality of life (St 
George's Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ) MD -1.61; 95% CI -2.93 to -0.29). In 
the control arm, tiotropium alone, the SGRQ improved by falling 4.5 units from 
baseline and with both treatments the improvement was a fall of 6.1 units from 
baseline (on average). High withdrawal rates in the trials increased the 
uncertainty in this result, and the GRADE assessment for this outcome was 
therefore moderate. There were no significant differences in the other primary 
outcomes (hospital admission or mortality).The secondary outcome of 
pre-bronchodilator FEV(1) showed a small mean increase with the addition of 
long-acting beta(2)-agonist (MD 0.07 L; 95% CI 0.05 to 0.09) over the control 
arm, which showed a change from baseline ranging from 0.03 L to 0.13 L on 
tiotropium alone. None of the other secondary outcomes (exacerbations, symptom 
scores, serious adverse events, and withdrawals) showed any statistically 
significant differences between the groups. There were wide confidence intervals 
around these outcomes and moderate heterogeneity for both exacerbations and 
withdrawals.The results from the one trial comparing the combination of 
tiotropium and long-acting beta(2)-agonist to long-acting beta(2)-agonist alone 
(417 participants) were insufficient to draw firm conclusions for this 
comparison.
AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: The results from this review indicate a small mean 
improvement in health-related quality of life for patients on a combination of 
tiotropium and long-acting beta(2)-agonist compared to tiotropium alone, but it 
is not clear how clinically important this mean difference may be. Hospital 
admission and mortality have not been shown to be altered by adding long-acting 
beta(2)-agonists to tiotropium. There were not enough data to determine the 
relative efficacy and safety of tiotropium plus long-acting beta(2)-agonist 
compared to long-acting beta(2)-agonist alone. There were insufficient data to 
make comparisons between the different long-acting beta(2)-agonists when used in 
addition to tiotropium.

BACKGROUND: The co-administration of inhaled corticosteroids and long-acting 
beta-agonists in a combined inhaler is intended to facilitate adherence to 
medication regimens, and to improve efficacy in COPD. In this review they are 
compared with mono component long acting beta agonists.
OBJECTIVES: To assess the efficacy of combined inhaled corticosteroids and 
long acting beta agonists preparations with mono component long-acting 
beta-agonists in adults with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
SEARCH STRATEGY: We searched the Cochrane Airways Group Specialised Register of 
trials. The date of the most recent search is April 2007.
SELECTION CRITERIA: Studies were included if they were randomised and 
double-blind. Studies could compare a combined inhaled corticosteroids and 
long-acting beta-agonist preparation with component long-acting beta-agonist 
preparation.
DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two reviewers independently assessed trial quality 
and extracted data. The primary outcomes were exacerbations, mortality and 
pneumonia, with health-related quality of life (measured by validated scales), 
lung function and side-effects as secondary outcomes. Dichotomous data were 
analysed as fixed effect odds ratios (OR), and continuous data as mean 
differences and 95% confidence intervals (CI). Sensitivity analysis was 
performed by combining data with a random effects model.
MAIN RESULTS: Ten studies of good methodological quality met the inclusion 
criteria, randomising 7598 participants with severe chronic obstructive 
pulmonary disease. Eight studies assessed fluticasone/salmeterol, and two 
studies budesonide/formoterol. The exacerbation rates with combined inhalers 
were reduced in comparison to long acting beta agonists alone (Rate Ratio 0.82, 
95% CI 0.78 to 0.88). There was no significant difference in mortality between 
combined inhalers and long acting beta agonists alone. Pneumonia occurred more 
commonly with combined inhalers (OR 1.62; 95% CI 1.35 to 1.94). There was no 
significant difference in terms of hospitalisations, although the two studies 
contributing data to this outcome may have been drawn from differing 
populations. Combination was more effective than LABA in improving quality of 
life measured by the St George Respiratory Questionnaire, and the Chronic 
Respiratory Questionnaire, and predose and post dose FEV1.
AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Combination therapy was more effective than long-acting 
beta-agonists in reducing exacerbation rates, although the evidence for the 
effects on hospitalisations was mixed, and requires further exploration. No 
significant impact on mortality was found even with additional information from 
the TORCH trial. The superiority of combination inhalers should be viewed 
against the increased risk of side-effects, particularly pneumonia. Additional 
studies on BDF are required and more information would be useful of the relative 
benefits and adverse event rates with different doses of inhaled 
corticosteroids.

OBJECTIVE: To compare the available literature regarding the use of long-acting 
muscarinic antagonist (LAMA)/long-acting β2 agonists (LABA) and inhaled 
corticosteroid (ICS)/LABA combination inhaler therapy in chronic obstructive 
pulmonary disease (COPD) maintenance therapy management.
DATA SOURCES: A MEDLINE literature search from database inception to February 
2017 was conducted using the search terms chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, 
adrenergic beta-agonist, muscarinic antagonist, and inhaled corticosteroid. 
References from extracted sources were further searched for any relevant, missed 
data sources.
STUDY SELECTION AND DATA EXTRACTION: All English-language randomized-controlled 
trials comparing LAMA/LABA and ICS/LABA combination inhaler therapy were 
evaluated.
DATA SYNTHESIS: A total of 10 randomized controlled trials have reviewed the use 
of LAMA/LABA compared with ICS/LABA therapy for COPD maintenance therapy. 
Results of clinical trials that evaluated LAMA/LABA and ICS/LABA maintenance 
therapy demonstrated superior improvements in pulmonary function tests via 
spirometry and improved clinical outcomes with LAMA/LABA therapy, specifically 
reduction in COPD exacerbation rates. The safety of LAMA/LABA combination 
therapy also is favorable compared with ICS/LABA combination therapy because of 
the increased infection risk with ICS therapy.
CONCLUSIONS: COPD is a disease state with significant morbidity and mortality in 
the United States and is the third leading cause of death. Long-acting inhalers 
are recommended for the majority of COPD severities, and combination therapy is 
typically utilized. LAMA/LABA combination therapy has demonstrated superior 
improvements in pulmonary function and reduction in COPD exacerbation rates 
compared with ICS/LABA. LAMA/LABA combination therapy will have a larger future 
role in COPD maintenance management.

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), characterized by persistent and 
partially reversible airflow obstruction, is a leading cause of morbidity and 
mortality worldwide. Long-acting inhaled bronchodilators form the backbone for 
the maintenance therapy for this disease. The ultra-long-acting β2-agonists 
(ultra-LABAs) represent novel pharmacologic agents with interesting potential 
benefits as stand-alone therapy or in combination with other therapies for the 
treatment of COPD. Areas covered: In this review, we will focus newly developed 
ultra-LABAs, describing currently available evidence of their clinical effect 
and safety, their comparison relative to older long-acting β2-agonists, and 
their potential niche in the maintenance treatment of COPD. We also provide an 
overview of the current landscape of available LABAs, and discuss the present 
understanding of the disease, and suggest possible future directions for COPD 
therapy. Expert opinion: Ultra-LABAs are pivotal bronchodilators in the 
maintenance therapy of COPD as monotherapy or in combination with other agents. 
Their long-acting effect permits once daily dosing and their improved delivery 
using novel devices and their safety profile represent an important advancement 
in management of this disease.

The Global Initiative for Asthma (GINA) annual report summarizes the latest 
evidence for asthma management. GINA recommends stepwise pharmacological 
treatment, advocating inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) plus rapid, long-acting 
β2-agonists (LABA) delivered in a single inhaler for maintenance and relief at 
Steps 3 (moderate persistent asthma requiring 1-2 controllers plus as-needed 
reliever), 4 (severe persistent asthma requiring ≥2 controllers plus as-needed 
reliever), and 5 (higher level care and/or add-on treatment). Areas covered: 
Randomized controlled trials and real-world evidence demonstrate that flexibly 
dosed budesonide/formoterol for maintenance and relief (Symbicort® Maintenance 
And Reliever Therapy [SMART]) is associated with reductions in severe 
exacerbations, prolongs time to first exacerbation, and provides fast symptom 
relief. Expert commentary: SMART provides greater or equal levels of sustained 
asthma control than similar or higher fixed doses of ICS/LABA plus short-acting 
β2-agonist (SABA) as needed or higher ICS plus SABA as needed, with lower 
overall ICS doses and cost. The simplified dosing strategy may improve adherence 
and overall asthma control but relies on patient education. 
Budesonide/formoterol as needed in mild asthma (patients qualifying for regular 
low-dose ICS) is currently under investigation in two double-blind randomized 
studies, SYGMA1/2 (NCT02149199/NCT02224157), comparing budesonide/formoterol as 
needed with budesonide plus SABA and SABA alone.

INTRODUCTION: Several dual bronchodilator fixed-dose inhaler medications were 
recently approved for the treatment of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease 
(COPD). These products combine a long-acting β2 -agonist (LABA) and long-acting 
muscarinic antagonist (LAMA). In clinical trials, the separate mechanisms of the 
bronchodilators resulted in improved lung function. COPD treatment guidelines 
currently recommend combination LABA/LAMA as alternative therapy to combination 
LABA/inhaled corticosteroid (ICS). Evidence is limited on the comparative 
effectiveness of LABA/LAMA and LABA/ICS in COPD. The objective of this study was 
to compare real-world COPD exacerbation rates among patients treated with 
LABA/LAMA with those treated with LABA/ICS.
METHODS: This was a retrospective observational study of COPD patients in the 
United States treated with LABA/LAMA or LABA/ICS combination. Insurance claims 
from January 1, 2004, through December 31, 2014, were used as the data source. 
Patients were required to have greater than one prescription filled for the 
combination medications, and they were followed from 30 days after drug 
initiation. Individuals were censored if they discontinued a study medication, 
initiated medication from the opposite cohort (LAMA or ICS), lost enrollment 
eligibility, or at the study period end. Exacerbation rates were compared using 
Poisson regression.
RESULTS: There were 5384 patients in the LABA/LAMA cohort and 473,388 patients 
in the LABA/ICS cohort. The LABA/LAMA cohort was older, had more comorbidities, 
and more severe COPD. Unadjusted annual exacerbation rates were 2.87 events per 
person-year (standard deviation [SD] 5.14) in the LABA/LAMA cohort and 1.68 (SD 
9.82) in the LABA/ICS cohort. The adjusted incidence rate ratio was 0.98 (95% 
confidence interval 0.95-1.01) for LABA/LAMA compared with LABA/ICS.
CONCLUSIONS: The LABA/LAMA combination had similar effectiveness to LABA/ICS as 
measured by exacerbation rates in COPD patients. As a result, characteristics 
other than effectiveness, such as symptom control, cost, patient preferences, 
and adverse events, may be important in selecting between the two regimens.

RATIONALE: Post hoc analyses suggest that blood eosinophils have potential as a 
predictive biomarker of inhaled corticosteroid efficacy in the management of 
chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).
OBJECTIVES: We prospectively investigated the value of blood eosinophils as a 
predictor of responsiveness to an inhaled corticosteroid/long-acting β2-agonist 
combination versus a long-acting β2-agonist/long-acting muscarinic antagonist 
combination for exacerbation prevention.
METHODS: We conducted prespecified analyses of data from the FLAME (Effect of 
Indacaterol Glycopyronium vs Fluticasone Salmeterol on COPD Exacerbations) 
study, which compared once-daily long-acting β2-agonist/long-acting muscarinic 
antagonist indacaterol/glycopyrronium 110/50 μg with twice-daily long-acting 
β2-agonist/inhaled corticosteroid salmeterol/fluticasone combination 50/500 μg 
in patients with one or more exacerbations in the preceding year. Subsequent 
post hoc analyses were conducted to address further cutoffs and endpoints.
MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: We compared treatment efficacy according to blood 
eosinophil percentage (<2% and ≥2%, <3% and ≥3%, and <5% and ≥5%) and absolute 
blood eosinophil count (<150 cells/μl, 150 to <300 cells/μl, and ≥300 cells/μl). 
Indacaterol/glycopyrronium was significantly superior to salmeterol/fluticasone 
for the prevention of exacerbations (all severities, or moderate or severe) in 
the <2%, ≥2%, <3%, <5%, and <150 cells/μl subgroups, and at no cutoff was 
salmeterol/fluticasone superior to indacaterol/glycopyrronium. Furthermore, the 
rate of moderate or severe exacerbations did not increase with increasing blood 
eosinophils. The incidence of pneumonia was higher in patients receiving 
salmeterol/fluticasone than indacaterol/glycopyrronium in both the <2% and ≥2% 
subgroups.
CONCLUSIONS: Our prospective analyses indicate that indacaterol/glycopyrronium 
provides superior or similar benefits over salmeterol/fluticasone regardless of 
blood eosinophil levels in patients with COPD. Clinical trial registered with 
www.clinicaltrials.gov (NCT01782326).

Indacaterol. A long-acting beta-2 agonist, no advantages in COPD.

[No authors listed]

In patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), bronchodilator 
drugs have only modest symptomatic efficacy. There is no evidence that they slow 
disease progression. A short-acting beta-2 agonist such as salbutamol is the 
first-choice treatment, used either on demand or on a regular basis. Long-acting 
beta2 agonists are an option for patients with nocturnal symptoms. Indacaterol 
is a long-acting beta-2 agonist that is inhaled once a day. Indacaterol has not 
been compared with a short-acting beta-2 agonist. Clinical evaluation is based 
on 4 double-blind randomised placebo-controlled trials, 3 of which also included 
a group treated with another long-acting bronchodilator (formoterol, salmeterol 
or tiotropium. The symptomatic efficacy of indacaterol was only modest, and 
similar to that of other long-acting bronchodilators. Indacaterol has the known 
adverse effect profile of beta-2 agonists. Some adverse effects seem to be more 
frequent than with other long-acting bronchodilators, including post-inhalation 
cough, hyperglycaemia, respiratory tract infections, and possibly cardiac 
disorders. There is no evidence that once-daily inhalation has any advantages 
over twice-daily inhalation, even in terms of convenience. In addition, as 
efficacy is limited, there is a risk that patients will use the drug more 
frequently, resulting in additional adverse effects. The nebulizer used to 
inhale the powder in the capsules is similar to the one provided with Foradil 
(formoterol. In practice, indacaterol offers no therapeutic advantage over 
existing treatments for patients with COPD. It is better to use the 
best-documented drugs and, if necessary, to add non-drug measures. Eliminating 
exposure to toxic agents, especially tobacco smoke, remains the only treatment 
with a proven benefit on the course of COPD.

BACKGROUND: The long-acting bronchodilator tiotropium and single inhaler 
combination therapy of inhaled corticosteroids and long-acting beta(2)-agonists 
are both commonly used for maintenance treatment of chronic obstructive 
pulmonary disease. Combining these treatments, which have different mechanisms 
of action, may be more effective than the individual components. However, the 
benefits and risks of using tiotropium and combination therapy together for the 
treatment of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease are unclear.
OBJECTIVES: To assess the relative effects of inhaled corticosteroid and 
long-acting beta(2)-agonist combination therapy in addition to tiotropium 
compared to tiotropium or combination therapy alone in patients with chronic 
obstructive pulmonary disease.
SEARCH STRATEGY: We searched the Cochrane Airways Group Specialised Register of 
trials (July 2010) and reference lists of articles.
SELECTION CRITERIA: We included parallel, randomised controlled trials of three 
months or longer, comparing inhaled corticosteroid and long-acting 
beta(2)-agonists combination therapy in addition to inhaled tiotropium against 
tiotropium alone or combination therapy alone.
DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: We independently assessed trials for inclusion and 
then extracted data on trial quality and outcome results. We contacted study 
authors for additional information. We collected information on adverse effects 
from the trials.
MAIN RESULTS: Three trials (1021 patients) were included comparing tiotropium in 
addition to inhaled corticosteroid and long-acting beta(2)-agonist combination 
therapy to tiotropium alone. The duration, type of combination treatment and 
definition of outcomes varied. The limited data led to wide confidence intervals 
and there was no significant statistical difference in mortality, participants 
with one or more hospitalisations, episodes of pneumonia or adverse events. The 
results on exacerbations were heterogeneous and were not combined. The mean 
health-related quality of life and lung function were significantly different 
when combination therapy was added to tiotropium, although the size of the 
average benefits of additional combination therapy were small, St George's 
Respiratory Questionnaire (MD -2.49; 95% CI -4.04 to -0.94) and forced 
expiratory volume in one second (MD 0.06 L; 95% CI 0.04 to 0.08).One trial (60 
patients) compared tiotropium plus combination therapy to combination therapy 
alone. The results from the trial were insufficient to draw firm conclusions for 
this comparison.
AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: To date there is uncertainty regarding the long-term 
benefits and risks of treatment with tiotropium in addition to inhaled 
corticosteroid and long-acting beta(2)-agonist combination therapy on mortality, 
hospitalisation, exacerbations of COPD and pneumonia. The addition of 
combination treatment to tiotropium has shown improvements in average 
health-related quality of life and lung function.

BACKGROUND: long acting beta agonists and inhaled corticosteroids have both been 
recommended in guidelines for the treatment of chronic obstructive pulmonary 
disease. Their co-administration in a combined inhaler is intended to facilitate 
adherence to medication regimens, and to improve efficacy.
OBJECTIVES: To assess the efficacy of combined inhaled corticosteroid and 
long-acting beta-agonist preparations, compared to placebo or the individual 
components, in the treatment of adults with chronic obstructive pulmonary 
disease.
SEARCH STRATEGY: We searched the Cochrane Airways Group chronic obstructive 
pulmonary disease (COPD) trials register. Date of last search April 2004.
SELECTION CRITERIA: Studies were included if they were randomised and 
double-blind. Studies could compare a combined inhaled corticosteroids and 
long-acting beta-agonist preparation with either component preparation or 
placebo.
DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two reviewers independently assessed trial quality 
and extracted data. The primary outcome was exacerbations.
MAIN RESULTS: Six randomised trials with 4118 participants were included. Two 
different combination preparations (fluticasone/salmeterol and 
budesonide/formoterol) were used. Combination treatment was more effective than 
placebo for mean exacerbation rates, quality of life and lung function. No 
trials were found comparing the combination of drugs in a single inhaler with 
the same drugs both given in separate inhalers. Exacerbations: 
Fluticasone/salmeterol did not significantly reduce exacerbations compared with 
either of its component treatments in one large study. There was no significant 
difference when budesonide/formoterol was compared with budesonide. 
Budesonide/formoterol was more effective than formoterol in reducing 
exacerbations (Rate ratio: 0.78 [0.68 to 0.90], two studies). A pooled analysis 
of both combination therapies indicated that exacerbations were less frequent 
when compared with either placebo or long-acting beta-agonist (versus placebo 
Rate ratio: 0.76 [0.68, 0.84], three studies, versus beta-agonist, Rate ratio: 
0.85 [0.77, 0.95], three studies), but not when compared with steroid. The 
clinical impact of this effect depends on the frequency of exacerbations 
experienced by patients. One full exacerbation was prevented for every two to 
four years of treatment in the type of patients included in the trials. Quality 
of Life: There were conflicting findings in quality of life and symptoms when 
fluticasone/salmeterol was compared with inhaled steroids alone (three studies). 
There was no significant difference between fluticasone/salmeterol and 
long-acting beta-agonist in quality of life scores (three studies). 
Budesonide/formoterol improved symptoms when compared with budesonide but not 
with formoterol. There were conflicting findings in quality of life scores when 
budesonide/formoterol was compared with component inhaled corticosteroid or 
beta-agonist. These may be accounted for by different study design. Lung 
Function: Treatment with either combination led to small, significant 
differences in lung function compared with component steroid medication. 
Fluticasone/salmeterol led to small improvements in FEV1 compared with 
salmeterol, but budesonide/formoterol treatment did not increase FEV1 
significantly when compared with formoterol.
REVIEWERS' CONCLUSIONS: Compared with placebo, combination therapy led to 
clinically meaningful differences in quality of life, symptoms and 
exacerbations. However, there were conflicting results when the different 
combination therapies were compared with the mono-components alone. In order to 
draw firmer conclusions about the effects of combination therapy in a single 
inhaler more data are necessary, including the assessment of the comparative 
effects with separate administration of the two drugs in double-dummy trials.

Long-acting beta-agonist treatment in patients with persistent asthma already 
receiving inhaled corticosteroids.

University of Otago, Dunedin, New Zealand.

International guidelines recommend that long acting beta agonists should be 
considered in patients who are symptomatic despite moderate doses of inhaled 
corticosteroids. When combined with inhaled corticosteroids they improve asthma 
symptoms and lung function and reduce exacerbations. The evidence suggests that 
they are well tolerated. However, they are less effective than inhaled 
corticosteroids as monotherapy and should not be used alone, although the 
addition of a long-acting beta-agonist may permit a small reduction in the 
corticosteroid dose. Both salmeterol and formoterol appear equally effective in 
improving asthma control. Formoterol, however, has a rapid onset of action and 
is now being promoted for the relief of acute asthma symptoms. Both drugs 
provide prolonged protection against exercise-induced bronchospasm. However, 
this effect rapidly diminishes with continuous therapy and if this is the main 
aim of treatment, intermittent use may be preferable. When compared with 
alternative treatments, inhaled long acting beta agonists are more effective in 
controlling asthma symptoms than either theophylline or antileukotriene agents. 
Bambuterol, an oral prodrug of terbutaline, appears to be as effective as the 
inhaled long acting beta agonists and has the advantage of once daily oral 
administration. However, the inhaled long acting beta agonists are less likely 
to have systemic adverse effects. There are theoretical concerns that regular 
beta-agonist treatment may lead to tolerance and a failure to respond to 
emergency asthma treatment. While there is no doubt that tolerance occurs, there 
is currently little evidence that this is a clinical problem. Insights into 
pharmacological as well as therapeutic interactions between inhaled 
corticosteroids and beta-agonists are providing justification for their use in 
combination. Guidelines for the management of patients with chronic persistent 
asthma are likely to require modification to reflect these developments.

long acting beta agonists are a pillar of therapy for many patients with asthma 
because they are the preferred add-on therapy to inhaled corticosteroids. 
However, a recent meta-analysis documented a substantial increase in severe 
exacerbations requiring hospital admission and life-threatening asthma 
exacerbations in patients treated with long acting beta agonists. A careful 
evaluation of this meta-analysis raises several concerns about its applicability 
to current practice. Pivotal trials evaluating the benefit of adding long-acting 
beta-agonists to inhaled corticosteroids were not included. The authors of the 
current paper call for physicians to continue their usual practice of using 
long acting beta agonists as adjunctive therapy, as well as for an independent 
meta-analysis of individual patients using inhaled corticosteroids and 
long acting beta agonists concomitantly.

BACKGROUND: Bronchial epithelial goblet cell metaplasia (GCM) with hyperplasia 
is a prominent feature of asthma, but the effects of treatment with 
corticosteroids alone or in combination with a long-acting β2 -adrenergic 
receptor agonist (LABA) on GCM in the bronchial epithelium are unknown.
OBJECTIVES: To determine whether corticosteroid alone or in combination with a 
LABA alters protein and gene expression pathways associated with IL-13-induced 
goblet cell metaplasia.
RESULTS: We evaluated the effects of fluticasone propionate (FP) and of 
salmeterol (SM), on the response of well-differentiated cultured bronchial 
epithelial cells to interleukin-13 (IL-13). Outcome measures included gene 
expression of SPDEF/FOXa2, gene expression and protein production of 
MUC5AC/MUC5B and morphologic appearance of cultured epithelial cell sheets. We 
additionally analysed expression of these genes in bronchial epithelial 
brushings from healthy, steroid-naïve asthmatic and steroid-treated asthmatic 
subjects. In cultured airway epithelial cells, FP treatment inhibited 
IL-13-induced suppression of FOXa2 gene expression and up-regulation of SPDEF, 
alterations in gene and protein measures of MUC5AC and MUC5B and induction of 
GCM. The addition of SM synergistically modified the effects of FP modestly-only 
for gel-forming mucin MUC5AC. In bronchial epithelial cells recovered from 
asthmatic vs healthy human subjects, we found FOXa2 and MUC5B gene expression to 
be reduced and SPDEF and MUC5AC gene expression to be increased; these 
alterations were not observed in bronchial epithelial cells recovered after 
treatment with inhaled corticosteroids.
CONCLUSION AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Corticosteroid treatment inhibits 
IL-13-induced GCM of the airways in asthma, possibly through its effects on 
SPDEF and FOXa2 regulation of mucin gene expression. These effects are modestly 
augmented by the addition of a long-acting ß-agonist. As we found evidence for 
drug treatment counteracting the effects of IL-13 on the epithelium, we conclude 
that further exploration into the mechanisms by which corticosteroids and 
long-acting β2 -adrenergic agonists confer protection against pathologic airway 
changes is warranted.

BACKGROUND: Overuse of short-acting beta-agonists (SABA) is described in asthma, 
but little is known about overuse of SABA in chronic obstructive pulmonary 
disease (COPD).
METHODS: Prospective 3-month cohort study of patients with moderate-to-severe 
COPD who were provided a portable electronic inhaler sensor to monitor daily 
SABA use. Subjects wore a pedometer for 3 seven-day periods and were asked to 
complete a daily diary of symptoms and inhaler use. Overuse was defined as >8 
actuations of their SABA per day while clinically stable.
RESULTS: Among 32 participants, 15 overused their SABA inhaler at least once 
(mean 8.6 ± 5.0 puffs/day), and 6 overused their inhaler more than 50% of 
monitored days. Compared to those with no overuse, overusers had greater dyspnea 
(modified Medical Research Council Dyspnea Scale: 2.7 vs. 1.9, p = 0.02), were 
more likely to use home oxygen (67% vs. 29%, p = 0.04), and were more likely to 
be on maximal inhaled therapy (long-acting beta-agonist, long-acting 
antimuscarinic agent, and an inhaled steroid: 40% vs. 6%, p = 0.03), and most 
had completed pulmonary rehabilitation (67% vs. 0%, p < 0.001). However, 27% of 
overusers of SABA were not on guideline-concordant COPD therapy.
CONCLUSIONS: Overuse of SABA was common and associated with increased disease 
severity and symptoms, even though overusers were on more COPD-related inhalers 
and more had completed pulmonary rehabilitation. More research is needed to 
understand factors associated with inhaler overuse and how to improve correct 
inhaler use.

Salmeterol: a novel, long-acting beta 2-agonist.

Meyer JM(1), Wenzel CL, Kradjan WA.

Author information:
(1)College of Pharmacy, University of Illinois at Chicago 60680.

OBJECTIVE: The clinical pharmacology, pharmacokinetics, clinical efficacy, and 
adverse effects of the long-acting beta 2-agonist salmeterol are reviewed.
DATA SOURCES: A MEDLINE search was performed to identify English-language 
publications pertaining to salmeterol.
STUDY SELECTION: Open and controlled trials were reviewed in assessing clinical 
efficacy. Only the results of controlled, randomized trials were considered in 
the effectiveness evaluation.
DATA EXTRACTION: The primary measures of effectiveness in the clinical trials 
were bronchodilator activity and reduction of hyperresponsiveness that may 
reflect antiinflammatory activity. Bronchodilator activity was measured as 
changes in pulmonary function; reduction of hyperresponsiveness was evaluated 
using respiratory challenge with methacholine, histamine, allergen, or cold air. 
Secondary measures included symptom scores, need for rescue doses, and patient 
preference.
DATA SYNTHESIS: Salmeterol is a selective, beta 2-agonist that has been studied 
in the treatment of exercise-induced, nocturnal, and allergen-induced asthma. 
Salmeterol interacts with the traditional beta-receptor in a similar manner as 
other beta-agonists, and it exhibits potent in vitro antiinflammatory effects as 
an inhibitor of inflammatory mediator release. Less evidence exists for its in 
vivo antiinflammatory activity. Salmeterol demonstrates prolonged receptor 
occupancy, which is thought to contribute to its long duration of action. The 
recommended dose is 50 micrograms via metered-dose inhaler or dry-powdered 
inhalation. In the published clinical trials, salmeterol was more effective than 
albuterol in treating asthma, including exercise and allergen-induced asthma. 
Salmeterol's major advantage over other inhaled beta-agonists is its long 
duration of action (12 hours), making it an excellent choice for treatment of 
nocturnal asthma. A potential disadvantage is delayed onset of action. 
Tachyphylaxis to salmeterol's bronchodilator effects has not been shown, but 
tolerance to its protective effects against methacholine-induced 
bronchoconstriction has occurred. Adverse effects reported have been mild and 
have included headache, tremor, and palpitations.
CONCLUSIONS: Salmeterol is an effective beta 2-agonist in the treatment of 
asthma. However, several issues require further investigation regarding its 
long-term effects on disease control, significance of antiinflammatory activity, 
and role as a rescue medication.

BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: β2 -adrenoceptor agonists are widely used in the 
management of obstructive airway diseases. Besides their bronchodilatory effect, 
several studies suggest inhibitory effects on various aspects of inflammation. 
The aim of our study was to determine the efficacy of the long-acting β2 
-adrenoceptor agonist olodaterol to inhibit pulmonary inflammation and to 
elucidate mechanism(s) underlying its anti-inflammatory actions.
EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH: Olodaterol was tested in murine and guinea pig models of 
cigarette smoke- and LPS-induced lung inflammation. Furthermore, effects of 
olodaterol on the LPS-induced pro-inflammatory mediator release from human 
parenchymal explants, CD11b adhesion molecule expression on human granulocytes 
TNF-α release from human whole blood and on the IL-8-induced migration of human 
peripheral blood neutrophils were investigated.
KEY RESULTS: Olodaterol dose-dependently attenuated cell influx and 
pro-inflammatory mediator release in murine and guinea pig models of pulmonary 
inflammation. These anti-inflammatory effects were observed at doses relevant to 
their bronchodilatory efficacy. Mechanistically, olodaterol attenuated 
pro-inflammatory mediator release from human parenchymal explants and whole 
blood and reduced expression of CD11b adhesion molecules on granulocytes, but 
without direct effects on IL-8-induced neutrophil transwell migration.
CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS: This is the first evidence for the 
anti-inflammatory efficacy of a β2 -adrenoceptor agonist in models of lung 
inflammation induced by cigarette smoke. The long-acting β2 -adrenoceptor 
agonist olodaterol attenuated pulmonary inflammation through mechanisms that are 
separate from direct inhibition of bronchoconstriction. Furthermore, the in vivo 
data suggest that the anti-inflammatory properties of olodaterol are maintained 
after repeated dosing for 4 days.
